If the categories are not precise, but rather fuzzy, as in the case of scientific disciplines, the systematic failures of ML classification can be informative about properties of the underlying categories. Here we classify a large volume of academic publications using only the abstract as information. From the publications that are classified differently by journal categories and ML categories (i.e., misclassified publications, when using the journal assignment as ground truth) we construct a network among disciplines. Analysis of these misclassifications provides insight in two topics at the core of the science of science: (1) Mapping out the interplay of disciplines. We show that this misclassification network is informative about the interplay of academic disciplines and it is similar to, but distinct from, a citation-based map of science, where nodes are scientific disciplines and an edge indicates a strong co-citation count between publications in these disciplines. (2) Analyzing the success of interdisciplinarity. By evaluating the citation patterns of publications, we show that misclassification can be linked to interdisciplinarity and, furthermore, that misclassified articles have different citation frequencies than correctly classified articles: In the highest 10 percent of journals in each discipline, these misclassified articles are on average cited more frequently, while in the rest of the journals they are cited less frequently. © The Author(s) 2024.",Interdisciplinary research; Machine learning; Maps of science,Scientific Reports,Article,2024,3,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1038/s41598-024-72364-5

However, there is limited systematic evidence on how these breakthroughs influence the evolution of scientific knowledge. Building on the concepts of disruption and consolidation in science, we categorize forward-citing papers into two distinct categories: Disruptive Citing Papers (DCP) and Consolidating Citing Papers (CCP). Analyzing the dynamic patterns of DCP and CCP in Nobel Prize–winning papers, we find that in the early postpublication phase, scientific breakthroughs generate more consolidating citations than disruptive citations. Additionally, CCP in this early phase demonstrate higher scientific impact. However, in the long-term phase, scientific breakthroughs generate more disruptive citations, with DCP often involving larger and more diverse teams. Linguistic analysis also uncovers nuanced differences between CCP and DCP. Furthermore, the dynamic patterns of knowledge flow in scientific breakthroughs differ significantly from control groups. Collectively, our results reveal that scientific breakthroughs initially consolidate knowledge before disrupting it in later phases, offering profound insights into the mechanisms driving scientific progress. © 2024 Alex J.

Who Is Left Out?,"As a racial group, Asians are incredibly diverse; however, psychology research may not capture heterogeneity within this social category. Recent findings suggest that U.S. perceivers consider East Asian (e.g., Chinese, Japanese) Americans as more prototypically Asian American than South (e.g., Indian, Pakistani) or Southeast Asian Americans (e.g., Filipino, Vietnamese; Goh & McCue, 2021). We investigated whether artifacts of this cultural default are present in research conducted by U.S.-based psychologists. We also examined non-U.S.-based research to understand the potential limits of this prototype and its influence on research, globally. We expected to observe that most participants in psychology research are of East Asian descent and that most stimuli used to represent Asian identity actually depict East Asian (versus South and Southeast Asian) identity. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a literature search of psychology publications that mentioned “Asian” in the abstract. In line with our hypothesis, researchers were more likely to include East Asian participants and to present East Asian stimuli than to include or present South or Southeast Asian participants and stimuli in their research – results we observed in research conducted both within and outside of the U.S. We draw on intersectionality theory to inform recommendations for how researchers may work toward greater diversity and inclusion in their research. © 2024 University of California Press.

This study aims to explore the knowledge map of TBS. Methods: We searched Scopus for “trabecular bone score” or “trabecular score” from the beginning to 2021. Our inclusion criteria were original articles and reviews that were related to TBS and our exclusion criteria were non-English articles, non-related to TBS, and document type other than original articles and reviews. and related documents were included for bibliometric analysis. Excel, VOS viewer, and Science of Science (Sci2) software were used for data synthesis. Results: From 749 retrieved articles, 652 articles were included for analysis. These documents were cited 12,153 times and had an H-index of 56. The most productivity belonged to the USA (n = 130 documents), Switzerland (n = 101), and Italy (n = 67). “Osteoporosis International” (n = 80) had the highest participation in publishing. The research topics of interest were mainly related to the applicability of TBS for fracture risk assessment in chronic endocrine disorders such as osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus. Bursting analysis of the title and abstract revealed the initial focus of the discriminative power of TBS for osteoporotic fracture and the more recent focus on comparing bone mineral density (BMD) and TBS in a variety of chronic diseases. Conclusion: The number of annual publications on TBS has increased, especially after 2016. These publications highlight the importance of in-depth knowledge of TBS in predicting fracture risk and also its strengths and limitations of treatment monitoring in different health conditions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Tehran University of Medical Sciences 2023.",Bone mineral density; Fracture risk; Knowledge map; Osteoporosis; Trabecular Bone Score; Trend,Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1007/s40200-023-01338-7

This study aims to untangle the relationship between interdisciplinarity and the time manuscripts spend navigating the peer review phase. Leveraging a large-scale bibliometric dataset comprising over three million journal articles, we uncover a robust positive association between paper interdisciplinary level and the duration of the peer review process. This relationship persists across diverse fields, journals with various impacts, and articles with different citation impacts. Moreover, we find that conventionality and reference age partly contribute to such delay. Notably, our investigation indicates that journal editors cannot fully account for the prolonged peer review delays for interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, our results underscore a noteworthy observation: referees generally pose more inquiries toward interdisciplinary endeavors. This is consistent with the fact that scientists submitting interdisciplinary manuscripts may inherently require additional time to adequately address the detailed comments and questions posed by referees. Our results have policy implications for funders, journal editors, and institutions seeking to promote and facilitate interdisciplinary research. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Interdisciplinary research; Peer review; Prepublication timelines; Science of science,Information Processing and Management,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1016/j.ipm.2024.103826

Yet, how journalists choose to present researchers in their stories is poorly understood. Using a comprehensive data set of 223,587 news stories from 288 US outlets reporting on 100,486 research papers across all areas of science, we investigate whether authors’ ethnicities, as inferred from names, are associated with whether journalists explicitly mention them by name. We find substantial disparities in mention rates across ethnic names. Researchers with non-Anglo names, especially those with East Asian and African names, are significantly less likely to be mentioned in their news stories, even with extensive controls for author prestige, semantic content, news outlets, publication venues, and research topics. The disparities are not fully explained by affiliation locations, suggesting that pragmatic factors play only a partial role. Furthermore, among US-based authors, journalists more often use authors’ institutions instead of names when referring to non-Anglo-named authors, suggesting that journalists’ rhetorical choices are also key. Overall, this study finds evidence of ethnic disparities in how often researchers are described in the media coverage of their research, likely affecting thousands of non-Anglo-named scholars in our data alone. © 2024 Hao Peng, Misha Teplitskiy, and David Jurgens.",ethnicity; gender; inequality; media coverage; science of science; visibility,Quantitative Science Studies,Article,2024,4,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1162/qss_a_00297

These objectives are accomplished in two stages. First, we propose an original way to interpret Husserl's claim that his phenomenology is non-explanatory. We demonstrate, contra accepted interpretations, that Husserl did not think phenomenology is non-explanatory, because it is descriptive or because it does not deal with causes. Instead, we demonstrate that Husserl concluded that phenomenology is non-explanatory, because it engages in a dialectical process of conceptual clarification. To substantiate this interpretation, we examine how Husserl understood the function of explanation in three different tiers of standard science and how he grasped the role of phenomenology in pure logic. Having properly clarified Husserl's conclusion—that phenomenology is non-explanatory—we then execute our second task, namely to challenge just that idea. We argue that Husserl has—despite his claims to the contrary—de facto and inadvertently described his phenomenology as an explanatory nomological science. Our paper therefore not only clears up a longstanding misinterpretation of Husserl, but opens a new area of debate concerning the status of phenomenology within the scientific nexus. © 2024 The Authors.

Here, we rely on unsupervised interpretable machine learning applied to the full text of each paper to systematically identify hidden citations. We find that for influential discoveries hidden citations outnumber citation counts, emerging regardless of publishing venue and discipline. We show that the prevalence of hidden citations is not driven by citation counts, but rather by the degree of the discourse on the topic within the text of the manuscripts, indicating that the more discussed is a discovery, the less visible it is to standard bibliometric analysis. Hidden citations indicate that bibliometric measures offer a limited perspective on quantifying the true impact of a discovery, raising the need to extract knowledge from the full text of the scientific corpus. © The Author(s) 2024.",catchphrase; foundational paper; hidden citation; latent Dirichlet allocation; science of science,PNAS Nexus,Article,2024,2,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae155

On the one hand, they appear as an essential tool for the advancement of knowledge. On the other hand, there is doubt about the metaphysical and epistemological bases of this confidence in scientific knowledge, which has led science down paths of skepticism and pragmatism. This paper aims to contribute philosophically to the rationality and ontological status of physics, taking as a starting point some works of the philosopher of science Evandro Agazzi. The article presented here introduces Agazzi’s thought and the core issues of his epistemology. It then defines the concepts of rigor and objectivity as understood by Agazzi, and finally establishes criteria of rigor and objectivity for physics, showing how they are verified in two classical experiments. Based on these ideas, it is shown that physics, as the science it is, has criteria of rigor and objectivity that allow it to effectively reach the real, thus responding to the formalist and pragmatist challenge. Thus, the article does not exhaust itself in a description of Agazzi’s thought, but will apply his ideas to the concrete field of physics, making explicit ideas that have not been sufficiently made explicit by the Italian philosopher. © 2024, Universidad Politecnica Salesiana.

Adda J.; Ottaviani M.,6602205611; 7005646972,"BOCCONI UNIVERSITY, Italy","GRANTMAKING, GRADING ON A CURVE, AND THE PARADOX OF RELATIVE EVALUATION IN NONMARKETS*","The article develops a model of nonmarket allocation of resources such as the awarding of grants to meritorious projects, honors to outstanding students, or journal slots to quality publications. On the supply side, the available budget of grants is awarded to applicants who are evaluated most favorably according to the noisy information available to reviewers. On the demand side, stronger candidates are more likely to obtain grants and thus self-select into applying, given that applications are costly. We establish that if evaluation is perfect, grading on a curve inefficiently discourages even the very best candidates from applying. More generally, when the budget is insufficient to award grants to all applicants, the equilibrium unravels if information is symmetric enough—the paradox of relative evaluation. Leveraging a technique based on the quantile function pioneered by Lehmann, we characterize a broad set of nonmarket allocation rules under which an increase in evaluation noise in a field (or course) raises equilibrium applications in that field, and reduces applications in all other fields. We empirically confirm these comparative statics by exploiting a change in the rule for apportioning the total budget to applications in different fields at the European Research Council, showing that a 1 standard deviation increase in own evaluation noise leads to a 0.4 standard deviation increase in the number of applications and budget share. Moreover, we derive insights for the design of evaluation institutions, particularly regarding the endogenous choice of noise by fields or courses and the optimal aggregation of fields into panels.

Design/methodology/approach: A power law model analyzes the relationship between research funding and citations of papers using 831,337 documents recorded in the Web of Science database. Findings: The original results reveal general characteristics of the diffusion of science in research fields: a) Funded articles receive higher citations compared to unfunded papers in journals; b) Funded articles exhibit a super-linear growth in citations, surpassing the increase seen in unfunded articles. This finding reveals a higher diffusion of scientific knowledge in funded articles. Moreover, c) funded articles in both basic and applied sciences demonstrate a similar expected change in citations, equivalent to about 1.23%, when the number of funded papers increases by 1% in journals. This result suggests, for the first time, that funding effect of scientific research is an invariant driver, irrespective of the nature of the basic or applied sciences. Originality/value: This evidence suggests empirical laws of funding for scientific citations that explain the importance of robust funding mechanisms for achieving impactful research outcomes in science and society. These findings here also highlight that funding for scientific research is a critical driving force in supporting citations and the dissemination of scientific knowledge in recorded documents in both basic and applied sciences. Practical implications: This comprehensive result provides a holistic view of the relationship between funding and citation performance in science to guide policymakers and R&D managers with science policies by directing funding to research in promoting the scientific development and higher diffusion of results for the progress of human society. © 2024 Mario Coccia, Saeed Roshani.",Citations; Dynamics of science; Evolution of science; Matthew effect; Power law model; Research funding; Research policy; Science diffusion; Science of science; Science policy; Scientific development; Scientific laws,Journal of Data and Information Science,Article,2024,10,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.2478/jdis-2024-0005

However, academic publishing offers a unique, more controlled context to study leadership with implications for leadership scholars and scholarship. Hence, we present a descriptive overview of women's representation across 33 years in 11 top management journals across levels of leaders in academic publishing (i.e., editors, associate editors, and editorial board members) and authors. To do so, we curated an archival dataset tracking women's representation over time and across these four levels (i.e., 21,510 authors and 4,173 leaders) with 51,360 data entries for the authors and 320,545 for the leaders. Overall, women's representation increased over time, which was explained by simple time trend effects. Only 32 of 135 editors were women (i.e., 23.7 %), and the share of women associate editors showed particularly drastic fluctuations. We did not observe a “leaky pipeline” except from the associate editor to editor step, as well as notable fluctuations—particularly after new editor appointments—and between journals. We discuss the influential roles editors and publishers have on women's representation in academic publishing and science more broadly as well as implications for future research and policy. © 2024",Academia; Academic Leaders; Authors; Diversity; Editors; Management; Science of Science; Scientific Leaders,Leadership Quarterly,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1016/j.leaqua.2024.101814

Various models of funding allocation became institutionalized in the 20th century, shaping the present landscape of research funding. There are numerous reasons for scientists to be dissatisfied with current funding schemes, including the imbalance between funding for curiosity-driven and mission-directed research, regional and country disparities, path-dependency of who gets funded, gender and race disparities, low interreviewer reliability, and the trade-off between the effort and time spent on writing or reviewing proposals and doing research. We discuss possible alternative models for dealing with these issues. These alternatives include incremental changes such as placing more weight on the proposals or on the investigators and representative composition of panel members, along with deeper reforms such as distributed or concentrated funding and partial lotteries in response to low inter-reviewer reliability. We also consider radical alternatives to current funding schemes: the removal of political governance and the introduction of international competitive applications to a World Research Council alongside national funding sources. There is likely no single best way to fund curiosity-driven research; we examine arguments for and against the possibility of systematically evaluating alternative models empirically.

Krauss A.,56921558900,"London School of Economics, London, United Kingdom; Institute for Economic Analysis, Spanish National Research Council, Barcelona, Spain",Science of science: A multidisciplinary field studying science,"Science and knowledge are studied by researchers across many disciplines, examining how they are developed, what their current boundaries are and how we can advance them. By integrating evidence across disparate disciplines, the holistic field of science of science can address these foundational questions. This field illustrates how science is shaped by many interconnected factors: the cognitive processes of scientists, the historical evolution of science, economic incentives, institutional influences, computational approaches, statistical, mathematical and instrumental foundations of scientific inference, scientometric measures, philosophical and ethical dimensions of scientific concepts, among other influences. Achieving a comprehensive overview of a multifaceted field like the science of science requires pulling together evidence from the many sub-fields studying science across the natural and social sciences and humanities. This enables developing an interdisciplinary perspective of scientific practice, a more holistic understanding of scientific processes and outcomes, and more nuanced perspectives to how scientific research is conducted, influenced and evolves. It enables leveraging the strengths of various disciplines to create a holistic view of the foundations of science. Different researchers study science from their own disciplinary perspective and use their own methods, and there is a large divide between quantitative and qualitative researchers as they commonly do not read or cite research using other methodological approaches. A broader, synthesizing paper employing a qualitative approach can however help provide a bridge between disciplines by pulling together aspects of science (economic, scientometric, psychological, philosophical etc.). Such an approach enables identifying, across the range of fields, the powerful role of our scientific methods and instruments in shaping most aspects of our knowledge and science, whereas economic, social and historical influences help shape what knowledge we pursue. A unifying theory is then outlined for science of science – the new-methods-drive-science theory. © 2024 The Author(s)",Foundations of knowledge; Foundations of science; Limits of knowledge; Limits of science; Metascience; Origins of knowledge; Origins of science; Science of science,Heliyon,Article,2024,0,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e36066

Citations made by all 87 journals in “sport sciences” from 2013 to 2022 were extracted, as was their 2022 JIF. JSC rates were calculated using a Poisson distribution method. A mixed-effects negative binomial regression examined changes in yearly JSC rates over time. The association between average JSC rates and JIF were compared using a negative binomial regression. The median JSC rate was 6.3 self-citations per 100 citations. JSC rates are increasing in sport sciences by ~ 10% per year (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.1, 95% CI 1.1–1.2; trivial effect). There was a significant negative association between JSC rate and JIF (IRR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.9, 1.0; trivial effect). Contrary to observations made in prior literature examining broader disciplines, the increasing JSC rate in sport sciences may be attributed to the growing maturity of this novel discipline. As sport-science topic areas become more established and appear in discipline specific journals, more JSCs may occur due to an increasing body of literature in these journals. The negative association between JSC rate and JIF may be due to specialized and less visible journals having a naturally lower JIF, as their impact is confined to a narrower field. © The Author(s) 2024.",Impact factor; Journal self-citation; Malpractice; Manipulation; Metascience; Trends,Scientometrics,Article,2024,1,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1007/s11192-024-05096-y

The study reveals a generational shift in which younger scientists, especially those working abroad, are increasingly publishing in English. This shift towards publishing in English contrasts with the practices of those working in Japan, who predominantly publish in Japanese and have not significantly adopted co-authorship. This article notes a decline in book publications in both English and Japanese among Japanese political scientists.

We suggest that such “one-liners” imply much larger x-y relationships than those we typically study. Given the multitude of factors that compete and interact to influence any human outcome, small effect sizes should not surprise us. And yet they do—as evidenced by the persistent and systematic underpowering of research studies in psychological science. We suggest an explanation. Effect size magnification is the tendency to exaggerate the importance of the variable under investigation because of the momentary neglect of others. Although problematic, this attentional focus serves a purpose akin to that of the eye’s fovea. We see a particular x-y relationship with greater acuity when it is the center of our attention. Debiasing remedies are not straightforward, but we recommend (a) recalibrating expectations about the effect sizes we study, (b) proactively exploring moderators and boundary conditions, and (c) periodically toggling our focus from the x variable we happen to study to the non-x variables we do not. © The Author(s) 2024.",effect size; focusing illusion; metascience; overconfidence; statistical power,Current Directions in Psychological Science,Article,2024,1,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1177/09637214241268222

In this paper, we propose a reviewer-reputation ranking algorithm to identify high-quality papers based on paper citations, where a reviewer's reputation is computed from the correlation between their past ratings and the current number of citations received by the papers they have evaluated. During the review process, reviewers with high reputation scores are given more weight to determine the quality of papers. We test the algorithm on an artificial network with 200 reviewers and 600 papers, as well as on the American Physical Society (APS) data set, including in the analysis 308,243 papers and 274,154 mutual citations.

According to the transverse science framework originally conceived by Shinn and Joerges, AI can be seen as an instrument which is progressively acquiring a universal character through its diffusion across science. In this paper we address empirically one aspect of this diffusion, namely the penetration of AI into a specific field of research. Taking neuroscience as a case study, we conduct a scientometric analysis of the development of AI in this field. We especially study the temporal egocentric citation network around the articles included in this literature, their represented journals and their authors linked together by a temporal collaboration network. We find that AI is driving the constitution of a particular disciplinary ecosystem in neuroscience which is distinct from other subfields, and which is gathering atypical scientific profiles who are coming from neuroscience or outside it. Moreover we observe that this AI community in neuroscience is socially confined in a specific subspace of the neuroscience collaboration network, which also publishes in a small set of dedicated journals that are mostly active in AI research. According to these results, the diffusion of AI in a discipline such as neuroscience didn’t really challenge its disciplinary orientations but rather induced the constitution of a dedicated socio-cognitive environment inside this field. © The Author(s) 2024.",Artificial Intelligence; Neuroscience; Research-technology; Science of science,Applied Network Science,Article,2024,0,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1007/s41109-024-00618-2

We test this assumption in a large, preregistered study surveying Americans’ explicit sentiments toward young, middle-aged, and older adults. Contrary to certain expectations about the scope and nature of ageism, responses from two crowdsourced online samples matched to the US adult population (N = 1,820) revealed that older adults garner the most favorable sentiments and young adults, the least favorable ones. This pattern held across a wide range of participant demographics and outcome variables, in both samples. Signaling derogation of young adults more than benign liking of older adults, participants high on SDO (i.e., a key antecedent of group prejudice) expressed even less favorable sentiments toward young adults—and more favorable ones toward older adults. In two follow-up, preregistered, forecasting surveys, lay participants (N = 500) were generally quite accurate at predicting these results; in contrast, social scientists (N = 241) underestimated how unfavorably respondents viewed young adults and how favorably they viewed older adults. In fact, the more expertise in ageism scientists had, the more biased their forecasts. In a rapidly aging world with exacerbated concerns over older adults’ welfare, young adults also face increasing economic, social, political, and ecological hardship. Our findings highlight the need for policymakers and social scientists to broaden their understanding of age biases and develop theory and policies that ponder discriminations targeting all age groups. © 2024 the Author(s).",age prejudice; age stereotypes; ageism; metascience; youngism,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Article,2024,2,NA,English,10.1073/pnas.2311009121

We find that graduate students in the psychological sciences show a boundary effect when relating p-values across.05. We propose this psychological boundary is learned through statistical training in NHST and reading a scientific literature replete with “statistical significance”. Consistent with this proposal, undergraduates do not show the same sensitivity to the.05 boundary. Additionally, the size of a graduate student’s boundary effect is not associated with their explicit endorsement of questionable research practices.

This study first analyzes topic evolution pattern from topics’ semantic consistency in the semantic vector space, and explore its possible causes. Specifically, we extract papers in the computer science field from Microsoft Academic Graph as our dataset. We propose a novel method for encoding a topic with numerous Contextualized Word Embeddings (CWE), in which the title and abstract fields of papers studying the topic is taken as its context. Subsequently, we employ three geometric metrics to analyze topics’ semantic consistency over time, from which the influence of the anisotropy of CWE is excluded. The K-Means clustering algorithm is employed to identify four general evolution patterns of semantic consistency, that is, semantic consistency increases (IM), decreases (DM), increases first and then decreases (Inverted U-shape), and decreases first and then increases (U-shape). We also find that research methods tend to show DM and U-shape, but research questions tend to be IM and Inverted U-shape. Finally, we further utilize the regression analysis to explore whether and, if so, how a series of key features of a topic affect its semantic consistency. Importantly, semantic consistency of a topic varies inversely with the semantic similarity between the topic and other topics. Overall, this study sheds light on the evolution law of topics, and helps researchers to understand these patterns from a geometric perspective. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Contextualized word embedding; Science of science; Semantic consistency; Topic evolution,Information Processing and Management,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1016/j.ipm.2024.103859

Despite the substantial efforts devoted to exploring the influence's measures and patterns of an individual scientific enterprise, it remains unclear how to quantify the mutual impact of multiple scientific activities. This work quantifies the relationship between the scientists' interactive activities and their influences with different patterns in the AMiner dataset. Specifically, inflation treatment and field normalization are introduced to process the big data of paper citations as the scientist's influence, and then the evolution of the influence is investigated for scientific activities in the citation and cooperation patterns through the Hawkes process. The results show that elite scientists have higher individual and interaction influences than ordinary scientists in all patterns found in the study, with permutation tests verifying the significance of the new findings. Moreover, the study compares the patterns found in two largest disciplines, i.e., STEM and Humanities, revealing the higher value of individual influence in STEM than in Humanities. Furthermore, it is found that the opposite trend of STEM and Humanities in the cooperation pattern suggests different cooperation habits of scientists in different disciplines. Overall, this investigation provides a feasible approach to addressing the scientific influence issue and deepening the quantitative understanding of the mutual influence of multiple scientific activities in science and society.  © 2014 IEEE.",Citation pattern; Hawkes process; interaction influence; science of science; scientific activity,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,Article,2024,3,NA,English,10.1109/TCSS.2023.3325264

The electrification literature boasts many studies using the credibility revolution toolkit, but at the same time, several systematic reviews demonstrate that the evidence is divided between very positive and muted effects. This bifurcation presents a challenge to the science-policy interface, where policymakers, lacking the resources to sift through the evidence, may be drawn to the results that serve their (agency's) interests. The interpretation is furthermore complicated by unresolved methodological debates circling around external validity as well as selective reporting and publication decisions. These features, we argue, are not particular to the electrification literature but inherent to the credibility revolution toolkit.

First, a dataset is constructed from metadata derived from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The dataset is then used to generate a global map representing a categorical scientific co-occurrence network. A research field is defined as interdisciplinary when multiple science categories are listed in its description. Second, the co-occurrence networks are subsequently compared between periods to determine changing patterns of influence in light of interdisciplinarity. Third, embedded topic modeling enables unsupervised association of interdisciplinary classification.

This matched meta-evaluation identified and analyzed 119 pairs of original research articles (RR vs. non-RR) from 33 psychology journals, matched for the journal of publication, time of publication, and research topic. The exploratory results show that RRs significantly reduced publication bias against null results and improved method and data transparency. However, RRs had lower citation counts than non-RRs, with a small effect size when controlling for days since publication. Additional exploratory analyses found that this effect remained significant after controlling for null-result reporting, transparency, the number of studies in an article and length of method and result sections, article title perception, open access, and authorship metrics (including the number of authors, the h-index of the first or corresponding authors). The overall public impact indexed by Altmetric attention scores and the number of Twitter posts were not significantly different between RRs and non-RRs. However, Twitter posts, but not citations and Altmetric attention scores, were moderated by journal reputation, with RRs receiving more attention in lower impact journals (5-year impact factor below 4.5).

Although methodological researchers routinely extend simulation study findings through follow-up work, few studies are ever replicated. Simulation studies are susceptible to factors that can contribute to replicability failures, however. This paper sought to conduct a meta-scientific study by replicating one highly cited simulation study (Curran et al., Psychological Methods, 1, 16-29, 1996) that investigated the robustness of normal theory maximum likelihood (ML)-based chi-square fit statistics under multivariate nonnormality. We further examined the generalizability of the original study findings across different nonnormal data generation algorithms. Our replication results were generally consistent with original findings, but we discerned several differences. Our generalizability results were more mixed. Only two results observed under the original data generation algorithm held completely across other algorithms examined. One of the most striking findings we observed was that results associated with the independent generator (IG) data generation algorithm vastly differed from other procedures examined and suggested that ML was robust to nonnormality for the particular factor model used in the simulation. Findings point to the reality that extant methodological recommendations may not be universally valid in contexts where multiple data generation algorithms exist for a given data characteristic. We recommend that researchers consider multiple approaches to generating a specific data or model characteristic (when more than one is available) to optimize the generalizability of simulation results. © The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2024.",Meta-science; Monte Carlo simulations; Nonnormality; Replication,Behavior Research Methods,Article,2024,3,NA,English,10.3758/s13428-024-02364-w

This study explores differences between female-led and male-led teams in terms of scientific impact, novelty, and disruption, utilizing a comprehensive data set of journal articles spanning from 1980 to 2016 across STEM fields. We employed Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) to match female and male scientists based on their characteristics. Subsequently, we applied multivariable logistic regression models to compare the outcomes of journal articles produced by female-led and male-led teams. Our analysis reveals that femaleled teams generate more novel and disruptive ideas. However, they tend to produce articles with less scientific impact compared to their male-led counterparts. This suggests a systemic undervaluation of the contributions of female scientists. Further analysis indicates that this gender bias intensifies in later career stages and with larger team sizes. Additionally, significant field-specific heterogeneity is observed, with the most pronounced bias found in Biology and Medicine.

In these studies, a large number of analysts try to answer the same research question using the same data. The key idea is the greater the variation in results, the greater the uncertainty in answering the research question and, accordingly, the lower the credibility of any individual research finding. Compared to individual replications, the large crowd of analysts allows for a more systematic investigation of uncertainty and its sources. However, many-analyst studies are also resourceintensive, and there are some doubts about their potential to provide credible assessments. We identify three issues that any many-analyst study must address: 1) identifying the source of variation in the results; 2) providing an incentive structure similar to that of standard research; and 3) conducting a proper meta-analysis of the results. We argue that some recent many-analyst studies have failed to address these issues satisfactorily and have therefore provided an overly pessimistic assessment of the credibility of science. We also provide some concrete guidance on how future many-analyst studies could provide a more constructive assessment. Copyright © 2024 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.

The study confirms the thesis of Fassin (2022) that—as for innovation in business—innovation in scientific knowledge does not necessarily originate from the top universities. It also corroborates the crucial role of the ‘idea champion’ or ‘concept advocates’. It are a few individuals who have started in different universities developing metrics and applying bibliometrics in their field, often solely and sometimes as a sideline to their major research areas. That makes the science of sciences a unique phenomenon in recent science. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2024.",Bibliometrics; Impact; Index; Innovation; Ranking; Universities,Scientometrics,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1007/s11192-024-05141-w

[Methods] Drawing on mature frameworks in science of science and informetrics, and combining the characteristics of altmetrics, a research framework is constructed from four dimensions: application scenarios, research questions, key methods, and exploratory methods. [Results] The application scenarios of altmetrics are summarized in scientific evaluation, scientific communication and knowledge diffusion. Specifically, indicator application, influencing factors and indicator construction are proposed for scientific evaluation scenarios. Communication strategies, communication structures, communication trends, and science-social interaction are proposed for scientific communication scenarios. And research questions on knowledge diffusion include diffusion strategy, diffusion structure and diffusion effect. And we combine three key analytical methods of causal inference, network analysis, and machine learning to explain each research design according to the problem. [Limitations] The frameworks proposed in this study faces challenges in terms of operability and implementation. Further empirical testing is needed in the future.

Our approach focuses on challenges in specifying scientific studies for scientific inference via statistical inference and is complementary to classical discussions in the philosophy of statistics. We particularly consider the challenges in replicating studies exactly, using the notion of the idealized experiment. We argue against treating reproducibility as an inherently desirable property of scientific results, and in favor of viewing it as a tool to measure the distance between an original study and its replications. To sensibly study the implications of replicability and results reproducibility on inference, such a measure of replication distance is needed. We present an effort to delineate such a framework here, addressing some challenges in capturing the components of scientific studies while identifying others as ongoing issues. We illustrate our measure of replication distance by simulations using a toy example. Rather than replications, we present purposefully planned modifications as an appropriate tool to inform scientific inquiry. Our ability to measure replication distance serves scientists in their search for replication-ready studies. We believe that likelihood-based and evidential approaches may play a critical role towards building statistics that effectively serve the practical needs of science. © 2024 by the authors.",idealized experiment; minimum viable experiment; philosophy of statistics; replication distance; reproducibility rate; scientific inference,Entropy,Article,2024,0,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.3390/e26100842

Quantifying the substantive content of criminology allows us to empirically disentangle this network and analyze how the interplay of research topic and international context influences knowledge production in the study of crime. Methods: In this paper we apply the topic embedding model, top2vec, mapping two decades of research in criminology and criminal justice (2001–2020). Using data generated by top2vec we enrich coauthorship network data—introducing themes and subdisciplines, and topical similarity measures—and analyze the relationship between topical and subdisciplinary overlap, geospatial distance, and publication coauthorship in a sample of mid-career researchers (N = 4068). Results: We find that these researchers disproportionately favor collaboration within their immediate network of collaborators and subdiscipline of criminology, but tend to establish new, synergistic collaborations with topically adjacent researchers. New collaborations appear to be independent of geographic distance, but US criminologists are less likely to collaborate internationally than Eurasian and Oceanic criminologists. Conclusions: Facilitating communication between researchers and organizations from adjacent subdisciplines could benefit researchers and produce new, innovative research. Encouraging comparative research would help international scholars, many of whom may rely on US collaborators, benefit more from US scholarship. Further applications for top2vec in the scientometric study of criminology, criminal justice, and legal studies are discussed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Coauthorship; Machine learning; Science of science; Social network analysis; Topic modelling,Journal of Quantitative Criminology,Article,2024,2,NA,English,10.1007/s10940-023-09574-z

Despite strict adherence to state-of the-art methodological norms, research results can vary when analyzing the same data. This article aims to explore this variability by examining the impact of researchers' analytical decisions when using different approaches to structural equation modeling (SEM), a widely used method in innovation management to estimate cause–effect relationships between constructs and their indicator variables. For this purpose, we invited SEM experts to estimate a model on absorptive capacity's impact on organizational innovation and performance using different SEM estimators. The results show considerable variability in effect sizes and significance levels, depending on the researchers' analytical choices. Our research underscores the necessity of transparent analytical decisions, urging researchers to acknowledge their results' uncertainty, to implement robustness checks, and to document the results from different analytical workflows. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations and guidelines on how to address results variability.

These changes may have favoured speed at the cost of accuracy and methodological rigour. In this study, we compare 100 COVID-related articles published in four major psychological journals between 2020 and 2022 with 100 non-COVID articles from the same journal issues and 100 pre-COVID articles published between 2017 and 2019. Articles were coded with regard to design features, sampling and recruitment features, and openness and transparency practices. Even though COVID research was, by and large, more 'observational' in nature and less experimentally controlled than non- or pre-COVID research, we found that COVID-related studies were more likely to use 'stronger' (i.e. more longitudinal and fewer cross-sectional) designs, larger samples, justify their sample sizes based on a priori power analysis, pre-register their hypotheses and analysis plans and make their data, materials and code openly available. Thus, COVID-related psychological research does not appear to be less rigorous in these regards than non-COVID research. © 2024 The Author(s).",COVID-19 pandemic; meta-science; open science; psychology; research quality,Royal Society Open Science,Article,2024,0,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1098/rsos.241311

Predictive models can address this limitation by streamlining the tedious evaluation process. Typically, a paper's reproducibility is inferred based on the availability of artifacts such as code, data, or supplemental information, often without extensive empirical investigation. To address these issues, we utilized artifacts of papers as fundamental units to develop a novel, dual-spectrum framework that focuses on author-centric and external-agent perspectives. We used the author-centric spectrum, followed by the external-agent spectrum, to guide a structured, model-based approach to quantify and assess reproducibility. We explored the interdependencies between different factors influencing reproducibility and found that linguistic features such as readability and lexical diversity are strongly correlated with papers achieving the highest statuses on both spectrums.

We analyze all articles appearing in these journals during the 20-year period of 2004–2023 (N = 22,040). To facilitate comparability with top journals in psychological science where the WEIRD bias is pervasive, we also compare the proportion of first authors affiliated with English-speaking WEIRD countries for the same five-year period (2014–2018) to test whether this bias is differentially applicable across these fields of research. We find that (1) the proportion of first authors and other authors affiliated with English-speaking WEIRD countries has generally decreased over time in our examined journals; (2) compared to psychological science, our food-related journals have a substantially larger proportion of first authors affiliated with nations other than English-speaking WEIRD countries; and (3) our included journals differ considerably in their prevalence of first authors and other authors affiliated with English-speaking WEIRD countries.

Research teams from big technology companies usually possess more data, bigger computing infrastructure, and research talent, granting them the advantages in advancing AI research. While most previous work focuses on investigating the advantages the industry has in the field of AI, and how their research publication is different from those published by academic teams, few research has been done to investigate whether working as an industry researcher is beneficial at the individual level. In this work, by analyzing co-authorship networks of researchers published in AI conferences, we investigate whether working in the industry gives researchers advantages in “intangible” forms, such as social capital, represented by the collaborative relationships they gained or maintained. Our result shows that the many advantages industry researchers possess correlate with the social capital they have, measured by degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality, and effective size.

We canvas three desiderata of scientific theories (explanation, prediction, and unification) and argue that the extent to which failures of replication prove problematic depends on the primary purpose of a theory. If the aim is to explain how nature works, then accuracy—and thus replicability—of the findings on which the theory is built is essential. If the aim is to predict outcomes, then replicability of findings from which the predictive model or theory is built is only important as far as it affects the reliability and accuracy of the predictions. If the aim is to unify and organize disparate findings, then the replicability of findings plays a non-essential role.

We focus on approximately 15,000 papers at the intersection of AI and COVID-19—arguably one of the major challenges of recent decades—and show that interdisciplinary collaborations between medical professionals and AI specialists have largely resulted in publications with low visibility and impact. Our findings suggest that impactful research depends less on the overall interdisciplinary of author teams and more on the diversity of knowledge they actually harness in their research.

We use citation network analysis in a novel manner to identify the specific topics to which his papers have made a particular contribution, allowing us to compare the citations of his papers with those of contemporary papers on the same topic, rather than on the same broad field as generally used to normalise citations. It appears that citation rates are highest for topics on which Bob has published a relatively large number of papers that have become core to a tightly-knit community of authors that cite each other. This analysis shows that an author's impact depends on the existence of a receptive community that is alert to the potential utility of papers from that author, and which uses, amplifies, extends and qualifies the contents of their papers—activities that entail reciprocal citation between authors. The obvious conclusion is that a scientist's impact depends on the use that his or her contemporaries make of his or her contributions, rather than on the contributions in themselves. © 2024 The Author(s).

Compared to a few decades ago, significantly more research in computing involves people aligned with a moral outlook and oriented toward more significant appreciation for this topic. Based on research with both a secondary and pragmatic approach, we present a transformative intention to advance the ethical and moral scenario related to the involvement of people in computing research and, additionally, improve scientific communications accordingly. Secondary research indicates that the scenario is chaotic and deficient, with several erroneous or problematic occurrences in research practice and communication. In the first consolidated effort, we bring a communication artifact, a textual framework, for better quality when reporting data on people’s involvement in research.

Variation in such choices across studies leads to heterogeneity in results that introduce an additional layer of uncertainty, limiting the generalizability of published scientific findings. We provide a framework for studying heterogeneity in the social sciences and divide heterogeneity into population, design, and analytical heterogeneity. Our framework suggests that after accounting for heterogeneity, the probability that the tested hypothesis is true for the average population, design, and analysis path can be much lower than implied by nominal error rates of statistically significant individual studies. We estimate each type's heterogeneity from 70 multilab replication studies, 11 prospective meta-analyses of studies employing different experimental designs, and 5 multianalyst studies. In our data, population heterogeneity tends to be relatively small, whereas design and analytical heterogeneity are large. Our results should, however, be interpreted cautiously due to the limited number of studies and the large uncertainty in the heterogeneity estimates. We discuss several ways to parse and account for heterogeneity in the context of different methodologies.

Clinical literature values reproducibility, with the highest grade evidence (class 1) consisting of meta-analysis demonstrating large therapeutic efficacy replicating across multiple studies. Conversely, pre-clinical literature values novelty over replication and lacks rigorous meta-analyses to assess reproducibility of effect sizes across multiple articles. Here, we applied modified clinical meta-analysis methods to pre-clinical studies, comparing effect sizes extracted from published literature to raw data on individual animals from these same studies. Literature-extracted data (LED) from numerical and graphical outcomes reported in publications were compared with individual animal data (IAD) deposited in a federally supported repository of SCI data. The animal groups from the IAD were matched with the same cohorts in the LED for a direct comparison. We applied random-effects meta-analysis to evaluate predictors of neuroconversion in LED versus IAD. We included publications with common injury models (contusive injuries) and standardized end-points (open field assessments). The extraction of data from 25 published articles yielded n = 1841 subjects, whereas IAD from these same articles included n = 2441 subjects. We observed differences in the number of experimental groups and animals per group, insufficient reporting of dropout animals, and missing information on experimental details. Meta-analysis revealed differences in effect sizes across LED versus IAD stratifications, for instance, severe injuries had the largest effect size in LED (standardized mean difference [SMD = 4.92]), but mild injuries had the largest effect size in IAD (SMD = 6.06). Publications with smaller sample sizes yielded larger effect sizes, while studies with larger sample sizes had smaller effects. The results demonstrate the feasibility of combining IAD analysis with traditional LED meta-analysis to assess effect size reproducibility in SCI. © Emma G.

Consequently, drastic steps should be taken by the American Psychological Association to curb its production. They support these claims with a bibliography of alleged RHR publications and other outputs appearing from 2012 on. To determine the validity of their claims, we conducted a content meta-analysis of the 268 peer-reviewed articles (excluding editorials, book reviews, etc.) listed in Section 1 of their bibliography. These were independently rated using the following dimensions (as explicated by BJ&W): (1) use of “folk” racial categories; (2) biological race realism; (3) claims that differences between “races” are due to selection and/or genetic factors - these being the core of BJ&W's definition of RHR. Additional criteria were: (4) discussion of racial “proxy” categories (e.g., nations); and (5) degree of interest shown in the articles by one White nationalist publication. Inter-rater reliability was acceptable (ICC3,k = 0.711, 95% CI = 0.633, 0.773). A Content factor was identified among the averaged ratings exhibiting strong positive loadings for 1, 2, and 3 (indicating an RHR program), but a significant negative loading for 4 (indicating that nations, etc. tend not to be employed as racial proxies, but are typically used rather than race in such studies), and a null loading for 5. The last result (along with consideration of data presented elsewhere in the bibliography) counteracts the idea that RHR constitutes “scientific racism”, or supports White nationalism. Only 23 % of the publications unambiguously (based on 100 % convergence between raters for 1, 2, and 3) qualify as RHR, with the plurality (37 %) appearing in one niche journal, consistent with strong scientific taboos against RHR. Moreover, 30% of the publications unambiguously had nothing to do with RHR. BJ&W's characterisation of their bibliography as evidencing wide scale “scientific racism” is therefore not compellingly supported by its contents. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Content meta-analysis; Controversies; Metascience; Scientific racism,Intelligence,Article,2025,0,NA,English,10.1016/j.intell.2024.101878

Specifically, we examined the trajectory, transparency, and diversity of these preprints as compared to PsyArXiv preprints unrelated to COVID-19 (n = 167) and articles published in psychology journal articles (n = 75) within the same time frame. Preprints related to COVID-19 had similar traction to published journal articles on COVID-19, but compared to preprints unrelated to COVID-19, the COVID-19 preprints were more likely to be subsequently published during a follow-up period (until 2 March 2021), were published more quickly, and received more citations. Preprints related to COVID-19 reported fewer open science practices than preprints unrelated to COVID-19, but more than COVID-19 journal articles. Primary affiliations for all preprints and journal articles predominantly originated from Western countries, but this was comparatively more for preprints (both related to and not related to COVID-19), even though preprints had more international authorship teams than journal articles. In conclusion, this study sheds light on preprint dissemination within the field of psychology amid the COVID-19 crisis, emphasising the swift spread, heightened probability of subsequent publication, and diverse adherence to open science practices among COVID-19-related preprints.

While interdisciplinarity and team diversity have been extensively studied, the temporal diversity of knowledge remains underexplored. This paper introduces a novel framework for assessing temporal diversity in scholarly research. Analyzing 31 million articles from the past seven decades, I revealed an increasing trend in temporal diversity, reflecting the cumulative nature of scientific knowledge. Additionally, I found that temporal diversity is negatively associated with citation impact but positively associated with disruption. These patterns are robust and consistent across different contexts. Moreover, the findings suggest that higher temporal diversity leading to greater disruption may be primarily due to the use of older references. However, the disadvantages of temporal diversity in terms of citation impact cannot be entirely explained by other factors. Collectively, this study elucidates the dynamics of temporal diversity and its implications for innovation, providing new frameworks in the science of science and evidence on how innovation is driven by the temporal diversity of knowledge. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Citation impact; Science of science; Scientific innovation; Temporal diversity,Journal of Informetrics,Article,2024,1,NA,English,10.1016/j.joi.2024.101594

We constructed a new index, the DDiv index, for this purpose. Design/methodology/approach: The DDiv index incorporates the degree of interdisciplinarity in the breakthrough index. To validate the index, a data set combining the publication records and citations of Nobel Prize laureates was divided into experimental and control groups. The validation methods included sensitivity analysis, correlation analysis and effectiveness analysis. Findings: The sensitivity analysis demonstrated the DDiv index’s ability to differentiate interdisciplinary breakthrough papers from various categories of papers. This index not only retains the strengths of the existing index in identifying breakthrough innovation but also captures interdisciplinary characteristics. The correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.555) between the interdisciplinary attributes of scientific research and the occurrence of breakthrough innovation. The effectiveness analysis showed that the DDiv index reached the highest prediction accuracy of 0.8. Furthermore, the DDiv index outperforms the traditional DI index in terms of accuracy when it comes to identifying interdisciplinary breakthrough innovation. Originality/value: This study proposed a practical and effective index that combines interdisciplinary and disruptive dimensions for detecting interdisciplinary breakthrough innovation.

Due to Hume's dictum and NFL theorems, no exact metanorms for the good performance of each object science can be obtained after just a finite number of levels up the hierarchy, and the progressive abstractness of each metadiscipline and consequent ill-definability of its methods and objects makes science—as defined by a minimal standard of scientificity—cease to exist above a certain metalevel, allowing for a still rational style of inquiry into science that can be called “philosophical.” Philosophical levels, transitively reflecting on science, peculiarly manifest a non–empirically learned urge to self-reflection constituting the properly normative aspect of philosophy of science. © 2024 Metaphilosophy LLC and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",AI; computational philosophy; epistemology of science; Hume; induction; inductive biases; machine learning; metalearning; metaphilosophy; metascience; normativity,Metaphilosophy,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1111/meta.12690

To devise strategies for enhancing transparency in scientific reports, the initial step is to assess the current state: to objectively measure the current level of transparency, identifying its shortcomings and associated factors, and to gauge improvements, for instance, following interventions. Here we present a new tool and a proof of concept to this endeavor. Using a checklist, we evaluated the methods transparency of a corpus of 180 papers published in 2011 and 2021 in five top-tier psychology journals. We specifically focused on the materials, procedures, and characteristics of population and sample. We summarized the level of transparency in the methods of each paper with the Transparency Of Methods (TOM) score. This score consists of the proportion of relevant information regarding the method that is available to the reader of a scientific report, either in the main text of the paper, or the appendixes, supplementary materials, and online open repository. It ranges from 0 (i.e., no transparency in the relevant aspects of the methods and materials) to 1 (i.e., the scientific report is fully transparent in all the relevant materials and methods). The results affirm TOM’s potential for assessing the transparency of scientific reporting and offer two snapshots of transparency in the methods of published papers, a decade apart. While they indicate progress has been made, there remains room for further enhancements and highlight specific areas that require attention. In conclusion, this work underscores the ongoing need for improvement in methods’ transparency and introduces a valuable tool, demonstrating its applicability as a means to evaluate the transparency of scientific reports. © 2024 University of California Press.

This is problematic because they can help to detect ‘false positives’ in published research and, in turn, contribute to scientific self-correction. The lack of replication studies is, among other factors, due to a rather passive editorial approach concerning replications by many journals, which does not encourage and may sometimes even actively discourage submission of replications. In this Perspective article, we advocate for a more proactive editorial approach concerning replications and suggest introducing journal-based replication marketplaces as a new publication track. We argue that such replication marketplaces could solve the longstanding problem of lacking independent replications. To establish these marketplaces, a designated part of a journal’s editorial board identifies the most relevant new findings reported within the journal’s pages and publicly offers them for replication. This public offering could be combined with small grants for authors to support these replications. Authors then compete for the first accepted registered report to conduct the related replications and can thus be sure that their replication will be published independent of the later findings. Replication marketplaces would not only increase the prevalence of independent replications but also help science to become more self-correcting. © 2024 The Author(s).",journal policies; meta-science; open science; replication; scientific self-correction,Royal Society Open Science,Article,2024,0,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1098/rsos.240850

The case of two CGIAR agricultural research programs for development,"CONTEXT: Understanding research collaboration in diverse scientific communities is key to building global agricultural research systems that support the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Characterizing collaboration patterns can inform decisions to enhance the structure and dynamics of research programs. OBJECTIVE: We introduce a new analytic framework for evaluating collaborative research networks based on scientific publications, and an associated conceptual framework for the role of research networks in achieving societal goals. We analyzed two CGIAR Research Programs: Grain Legumes and Dryland Cereals (GLDC) and Roots, Tubers and Bananas (RTB). The analysis provides a multi-dimensional perspective on a set of key questions related to research team composition, research management structures, and performance of scientific publications. METHODS: We quantified network structures of research collaborations at the level of authors, institutions, countries, and management structures, including use of temporal exponential random graph models. We used regression models to understand the associations between the characteristics of authors and publications, and the corresponding citation rates and Altmetric Attention Scores. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified key network hubs in the collaboration networks of both CGIAR programs. The proportion of women as authors in publications was less than a third, with a low likelihood of co-authorship between women. Institutional hubs were identified by institutional categories; these were often institutions that are considered CGIAR program “participants”, and a few were “planning partners”. For both GLDC and RTB, the countries that were the focus of most research coincided with the program's priority countries. Most international collaborations occurred between institutions headquartered in Global South countries, but most intercontinental collaborations occurred between Global South and Global North countries. Most institution and author co-authorships occurred in only one year and rarely lasted two or three consecutive years. High diversity in the geographic affiliations of authors, along with highly collaborative teams, as opposed to simply the number of authors, consistently were associated with more citations and higher Altmetric Attention Scores. SIGNIFICANCE: These analyses reveal key structures in research collaboration networks in GLDC and RTB research programs, with potential to guide agricultural research systems for sustainable development. Considering these outcomes from past research management can help scientists, program managers, and funders increase the success of new research projects. Specifically, future research management strategies need to fortify existing scientific capacity and development through gender parity and balanced international collaborations, working toward more impactful publications and increased development relevance, while team size increases over time. © 2024 The Authors",Agricultural innovation; Knowledge management; Network analysis; Science mapping; Science of science; Successful research networks; Web of Science,Agricultural Systems,Article,2024,1,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1016/j.agsy.2024.104013

Group sequential designs, which allow researchers to perform interim analyses while data collection is ongoing, could offer a remedy. However, they are scarcely used in consumer behavior research, probably owing to low awareness, perceived complexity, or concerns about the validity of this approach. This article offers a tutorial on group sequential designs and introduces Pre-Registered Interim Analysis Designs (PRIADs): A practical five-step procedure to facilitate the adoption of these designs in marketing. We show that group sequential designs can be easily adopted by marketing researchers, and introduce a companion app to help researchers implement them. We demonstrate multiple benefits of PRIADs for researchers engaged in confirmatory hypothesis testing: They facilitate sample size decisions, allow researchers to achieve a desired level of statistical power with a smaller number of observations, and help conduct more efficient pilot studies. We validate this cost-saving potential through a comprehensive re-analysis of 212 studies published in the Journal of Consumer Research, which shows that using PRIADs would have reduced participant costs by 20–29%. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and possible alternatives to PRIADs. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Journal of Consumer Research, Inc.

Using bibliometric data from the Web of Science (WoS), we conduct a large-scale and cross-disciplinary assessment of the proportion of articles that use linear models in comparison to other analysis frameworks from 1990 to 2022 and investigate the spatial and citation patterns. We found that, in absolute terms, linear models are widely used across all fields of science. In relative terms, three patterns suggest that linear-model-based research is a dominant analysis framework in Social Sciences. First, almost two-thirds of research articles reporting a statistical analysis framework reported linear models. Second, research articles from underrepresented countries in the WoS data displayed the highest proportions of articles reporting linear models. Third, there was a citation premium to articles reporting linear models in terms of being cited at least once for the entire period, and for the average number of citations until 2012. The confluence of these patterns may not be beneficial to the Social Sciences, as it could marginalize theories incompatible with the linear models’ framework.

As a critical task in the Science of Science (SciSci), automatically mining technology trends from massive scientific publications have attracted broad research interests in various communities. While existing approaches can achieve remarkable performance, there are still many critical challenges to address, such as data sparsity, cross-document influence, and temporal dependency. To this end, in this paper, we propose a technical terms-based graph propagated neural topic model for mining technology trends in scientific publications. Specifically, we first utilize the documents’ citation relations and technical terms to construct a heterogeneous graph. Then, we design a term propagation network to spread the technical terms on the heterogeneous graph to overcome the sparseness of technical terms. In addition, we develop a dynamic embedded topic modeling method to capture the temporal dependencies for technical terms in cross-document, which can discover the distribution of technical terms over time. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world scientific datasets validate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach compared with state-of-the-art baselines. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.",Neural topic modeling; Science of science; Technology trend mining,Knowledge and Information Systems,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1007/s10115-023-02005-2

Despite the weight of this claim, it has not yet been subjected to a systematic empirical test. This paper addresses this research gap using the tribalization approach and diachronic co-citation analyses. Based on 22,430 papers published in 14 MOS journals between 1980 and 2019, we calculate local and global centrality measures and the flow of cited articles between co-citation communities over time. In addition, we use a node-removal strategy to test whether only ritualized citations ensure MOS cohesion. Rather than tribalization, our results suggest a center–periphery structure. Furthermore, more peripheral papers are integrated into the central co-citation communities, but the lion's share of the flow of cited papers occurs over time to only a small number of large clusters.

While the quantity of published research about TCIM has increased exponentially, critics have argued that the field faces challenges related to methodological rigour, reproducibility, and overall quality. This article proposes meta-research as one approach to evaluating and improving the quality of TCIM research. Meta-research, also known as research about research, can be defined as “the study of research itself: its methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives”. By systematically evaluating methodological rigour, identifying biases, and promoting transparency, meta-research can enhance the reliability and credibility of TCIM research. Specific topics of interest that are discussed in this article include the following: 1) study design and research methodology, 2) reporting of research, 3) research ethics, integrity, and misconduct, 4) replicability and reproducibility, 5) peer review and journal editorial practices, 6) research funding: grants and awards, and 7) hiring, promotion, and tenure. For each topic, we provide case examples to illustrate meta-research applications in TCIM. We argue that meta-research initiatives can contribute to maintaining public trust, safeguarding research integrity, and advancing evidence based TCIM practice, while challenges include navigating methodological complexities, biases, and disparities in funding and academic recognition.

(2015) “A meta-analysis of criterion effects for the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) in the clinical domain”,"The meta-analysis reported in Vahey et al. (2015) concluded that the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) has high clinical criterion validity (meta-analytic r‾ = .45) and therefore “the potential of the IRAP as a tool for clinical assessment” (p. 64). Vahey et al. (2015) also reported power analyses, and the article is frequently cited for sample size determination in IRAP studies, especially their heuristic of N > 37. This article attempts to verify those results. Results were found to have very poor reproducibility at almost every stage of the data extraction and analysis with errors generally biased towards inflating the effect size. The reported meta-analysis results were found to be mathematically implausible and could not be reproduced despite numerous attempts. Multiple internal discrepancies were found in the effect sizes such as between the forest plot and funnel plot, and between the forest plot and the supplementary data. 23 of the 56 (41.1%) individual effect sizes were not actually criterion effects and did not meet the original inclusion criteria. The original results were also undermined by combining effect sizes with different estimands. Reextraction of effect sizes from the original articles revealed 360 additional effect sizes that met inclusion criteria that should have been included in the original analysis. Examples of selection bias in the inclusion of larger effect sizes were observed. A new meta-analysis was calculated to understand the compound impact of these errors (i.e., without endorsing its results as a valid estimate of the IRAP's criterion validity). The effect size was half the size of the original (r‾ = .22), and the power analyses recommended sample sizes nearly 10 times larger than the original (N > 346), which no published original study using the IRAP has met. In aggregate, this seriously undermines the credibility and utility of the original article's conclusions and recommendations. Vahey et al. (2015) appears to need substantial correction at minimum. In particular, researchers should not rely on its results for sample size justification.

A systematic review,"OBJECTIVE Spin is characterized as a misinterpretation of results that, whether deliberate or unintentional, culminates in misleading conclusions and steers readers toward an excessively optimistic perspective of the data. The primary objective of this systematic review was to estimate the prevalence and nature of spin within the traumatic brain injury (TBI) literature. Additionally, the identification of associated factors is intended to provide guidance for future research practices. METHODS The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations were followed. A search of the MEDLINE/PubMed database was conducted to identify English-language articles published between January 1960 and July 2020. Inclusion criteria encompassed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that exclusively enrolled TBI patients, investigating various interventions, whether surgical or nonsurgical, and that were published in high-impact journals. Spin was defined as 1) a focus on statistically significant results not based on the primary outcome; 2) interpreting statistically nonsignificant results for a superiority analysis of the primary outcome; 3) claiming or emphasizing the beneficial effect of the treatment despite statistically nonsignificant results; 4) conclusion focused in the per-protocol or as-treated analysis instead of the intention-to-treat (ITT) results; 5) incorrect statistical analysis; or 6) republication of a significant secondary analysis without proper acknowledgment of the primary outcome analysis result. Primary outcomes were those explicitly reported as such in the published article. Studies without a clear primary outcome were excluded. The study characteristics were described using traditional descriptive statistics and an exploratory inferential analysis was performed to identify those associated with spin. The studies’ risk of bias was evaluated by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS A total of 150 RCTs were included and 22% (n = 33) had spin, most commonly spin types 1 and 3. The overall risk of bias (p < 0.001), a neurosurgery department member as the first author (p = 0.009), absence of a statistician among authors (p = 0.042), and smaller sample sizes (p = 0.033) were associated with spin. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of spin in the TBI literature is high, even at leading medical journals. Studies with higher risks of bias are more frequently associated with spin. Critical interpretation of results and authors’ conclusions is advisable regardless of the study design and published journal. ©AANS 2024,",metascience; neurosurgery; spin; trauma; traumatic brain injury,Journal of Neurosurgery,Article,2024,2,NA,English,10.3171/2023.11.JNS231822

Using biomedical papers as the data source, we constructed two evaluation datasets based on Nobel Prize papers and disruptive index. The evaluation performance of multiple LLMs of different types and scales on the datasets was scrutinized through the analysis of originality score (OS), originality type (OT), and originality description (OD), all of which were generated by the LLM. Our results show that LLMs can to some extent discern papers with distinct originality level via OS; however, they appear to be overly lenient reviewers. In LLMs’ evaluation mechanism, five distinct OTs reflecting varied research contributions do not manifest independently, but together they positively influence OS.

We identify two types of researchers from their individual mobility patterns: interdisciplinary explorers who pioneer new fields, and exploiters who are more likely to stay within their specific areas of expertise. Our results suggest that spatial mobility analysis is a valuable tool for understanding the evolution of science. © The Author(s) 2024.",Human mobility; Knowledge exploration; Science of science; Social dynamics,EPJ Data Science,Article,2024,1,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1140/epjds/s13688-024-00451-8

We use a unique dataset of academic publishing and careers to chart the more or less successful postdoctoral paths. We build a measure of academic success on the citation patterns two to five years into a faculty career. Then, we monitor how students’ postdoc positions—in terms of relocation, change of topic, and early well-cited papers—relate to their early-career success. One key finding is that the postdoc period seems more important than the doctoral training to achieve this form of success. This is especially interesting in light of the many studies of academic faculty hiring that link Ph.D. granting institutions and hires, omitting the postdoc stage.

As Pradeu et al. (British Journal for the Philosophy of Science https://doi.org/10.1086/715518, 2021) and Khelfaoui et al. (Synthese 199:6219, 2021) recently show, part of this relation is constituted by “philosophy in science”: the use of philosophical methods to address questions in the sciences. But another part is what one might call “science in philosophy”: the use of methods drawn from the sciences to tackle philosophical questions. In this paper, we focus on one class of such methods and examine the role that model-based methods play within “science in philosophy”. To do this, we first build a bibliographic coupling network with Web of Science records of all papers published in philosophy of science journals from 2000 to 2020 (N=9217). After detecting the most prominent communities of papers in the network, we use a supervised classifier to identify all papers that use model-based methods. Drawing on work in cultural evolution, we also propose a model to represent the evolution of methods in each one of these communities. Finally, we measure the strength of cultural selection for model-based methods during the given time period by integrating model and data. Results indicate not only that model-based methods have had a significant presence in philosophy of science over the last two decades, but also that there is considerable variation in their use across communities. Results further indicate that some communities have experienced strong selection for the use of model-based methods but that other have not; we validate this finding with a logistic regression of paper methodology on publication year. We conclude by discussing some implications of our findings and suggest that model-based methods play an increasingly important role within “science in philosophy” in some but not all areas of philosophy of science. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2024.",Bibliographic network; Cultural evolution; Metascience; Philosophy of science,Scientometrics,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1007/s11192-024-04931-6

Design/Methodology/Approach: This study utilizes a power law model to explore the relationship between research funding and citations of related papers. The study here analyzes 3,539 recorded documents by Nobel Laureates in physics, chemistry and medicine and a broader dataset of 183,016 documents related to the fields of physics, medicine, and chemistry recorded in the Web of Science database. Findings: Results reveal that in chemistry and medicine, funded researches published in papers of Nobel Laureates have higher citations than unfunded studies published in articles; vice versa high citations of Nobel Laureates in physics are for unfunded studies published in papers. Instead, when overall data of publications and citations in physics, chemistry and medicine are analyzed, all papers based on funded researches show higher citations than unfunded ones. Originality/Value: Results clarify the driving role of research funding for science diffusion that are systematized in general properties: a) articles concerning funded researches receive more citations than (un)funded studies published in papers of physics, chemistry and medicine sciences, generating a high Matthew effect (a higher growth of citations with the increase in the number of papers); b) research funding increases the citations of articles in fields oriented to applied research (e.g., chemistry and medicine) more than fields oriented towards basic research (e.g., physics). Practical Implications: The results here explain some characteristics of scientific development and diffusion, highlighting the critical role of research funding in fostering citations and the expansion of scientific knowledge. This finding can support decisionmaking of policymakers and R&D managers to improve the effectiveness in allocating financial resources in science policies to generate a higher positive scientific and societal impact.  © 2024 Mario Coccia et al., published by Sciendo.",Applied research; Basic research; Citations; Matthew effect; Nobel Laureates; Nobel Prizes; Power-law distribution; Research funding; Science diffusion; Science of Science; Scientific change,Journal of Data and Information Science,Article,2024,8,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.2478/jdis-2024-0006

An important point is that Leydesdorff and his colleagues rejected so-called dual concepts, i.e. concepts that mix or are influenced by at least two of the three basic components of diversity. A few years ago Chao and Ricotta took a new look at “evenness” and showed that the Gini evenness measure, as well as the Lorenz curve, are dual concepts as they are influenced by variety. For this reason, I propose to replace the Gini evenness measure in DIV* with an evenness measure, actually an evenness profile, that is not influenced by variety. © 2023, El Profesional de la Informacion.

However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the knowledge held by farm advisors, students, and economists with regards to farmers' risk preferences. Misconceptions about farmers' willingness to take risks could lead to misguided advice. This study builds upon a recent multinational endeavor that employed a multiple price list to assess risk preferences among European farmers. We expand this research by gathering predictions for farmers' risk preferences from 561 farm advisors, students, and economists. Our objectives are threefold: firstly, we explore variations as to how accurately participants can predict risk preferences in different specializations; secondly, we compare the predictive accuracy of different groups of forecasters; and thirdly, we assess whether modifying incentive mechanisms can improve the accuracy of predictions. Whereas our findings reveal substantial variation in individual predictions, the averages closely align with the observed responses of farmers. Notably, the most accurate predictions were provided by a sample of experimental economics researchers. Furthermore,predictions for different production systems exhibit minimal disparities. Introducing incentive schemes, such as a tournament structure, where the best prediction receives a reward, or a high-accuracy system, where randomly selected participants are compensated for the accuracy of their predictions, does not significantly impact accuracy. Further research and exploration are needed to identify the most reliable sources of advice for farmers.  © 2024 The Author(s).

This unequal writing practice has serious ramifications for both the history and future of psychological science, as it solidifies in the permanent scientific record the false notion that research with White samples is more generalizable and valuable than research with samples of color. In the present research, we experimentally tested the extent to which PhD students (63% White students, 27% students of color) engaged in this unequal writing practice, as well as the extent to which this practice might be disrupted by journal policies. In Study 1, PhD students who read about research conducted with a White sample, compared to those who read about the exact same research conducted with a Black sample, were significantly less likely to mention the sample’s racial identity when generating research titles, keywords, and summaries. In Study 2, PhD students instructed to mention the racial identity of their samples, and PhD students instructed to not mention the identity of their samples (though to a lesser extent), were less likely to write about the White versus Black samples unequally. Across both studies, we found that PhD students were overall supportive of a policy to make the racial demographics of samples more transparent, believing that it would help to reduce racial biases in the field. © 2024 American Psychological Association",generics; metascience; racial hegemony; racial inequality,American Psychologist,Article,2024,1,NA,English,10.1037/amp0001310

The paper presents a reconsideration of the foundations of the discipline of Science Studies, taking into account post-non-classical ideas about science. This approach positions Science Studies not only as a scientific field but also as an educational discipline aimed at novice researchers. Aim. The present research aimed to assess the current state of science as a scientific and educational discipline in the Russian and Euro-American scientific traditions. It also aimed to present the project of teaching the discipline of Science Studies as a rigorous science, encompassing both its fundamental and applied aspects, and utilising quantitative and qualitative research methods. Methodology and research methods. The synthesis of universal evolutionism approaches (including deterministic chaos concepts) and the methods of quantitative and qualitative content analysis were employed. Results. A quantitative analysis of the state of science in Russia was conducted. The analysis revealed an increase in the interest of Russian researchers in scientific issues. However, it also highlighted a lack of clear understanding of its disciplinary parameters. Scientific novelty and practical significance. It is proved that Science Studies can be a significant incentive for the growth of scientific knowledge in Russia. The work has led to an understanding of the role of epistemological (cognitive) and social mechanisms in the development of science. © Yarkova E.N. Zhukov A.V. Suvorova L.G.

In this article, we integrate and build on this work by demonstrating the breadth of these challenges. We show that tracking auxiliary assumptions is difficult because they are made at different stages of theory testing and at multiple levels of a theory. We focus on these issues in a reanalysis of a seminal study and its replications, both of which use a simple working-memory paradigm and a mainstream computational modeling approach. These studies provide the main evidence for “all-or-none” recognition models of visual working memory and are still used as the basis for how to measure performance in popular visual working-memory tasks. In our reanalysis, we find that core practical auxiliary assumptions were unchecked and violated; the original model comparison metrics and data were not diagnostic in several experiments. Furthermore, we find that models were not matched on “theory general” auxiliary assumptions, meaning that the set of tested models was restricted, and not matched in theoretical scope. After testing these auxiliary assumptions and identifying diagnostic testing conditions, we find evidence for the opposite conclusion. That is, continuous resource models outperform all-or-none models. Together, our work demonstrates why tracking and testing auxiliary assumptions remains a fundamental challenge, even in prominent studies led by careful, computationally minded researchers. Our work also serves as a conceptual guide on how to identify and test the gamut of auxiliary assumptions in theory assessment, and we discuss these ideas in the context of contemporary approaches to scientific discovery. © Crown 2024.",Auxiliary assumptions; Discrete-slot models; K capacity; Measurement; Memory; Metascience; Signal detection models; Visual working memory limits,Psychonomic Bulletin and Review,Review,2024,0,NA,English,10.3758/s13423-024-02562-9

The school had a diverse organizer team, composed of 26 researchers (17 from under represented areas: Subsaharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Central and South America); and a diverse volunteer team, with a total of 95 volunteers from 35 different countries, nearly half from under represented areas.

A post-school questionnaire revealed that 99% of participants enjoyed taking part in the school. Not with standing these positive quantitative outcomes, qualitative comments suggested we fell short in several areas, including the geographic diversity among lecturers and greater customization of contents to the participants’ contexts.

Despite this, the framing of diseases in medical research literature is largely unexplored. This scoping review examines a prevalent medical issue with social determinants influenced by the framing of its pathogenesis: obesity. Specifically, we compare the currently dominant framing of obesity as an addiction to food with the emerging frame of obesity developing from neuroinflammation. We triangulate both corpus linguistic and bibliometric analysis of the top 200 most engaging neuroscience journal articles discussing obesity that were published open access in the past 10 years. The constructed Neurobesity Corpus is available for public use. The scoping review analysis confirmed that neuroinflammation is an emerging way for obesity to be framed in medical research.

Current research on scientists’ mobility focuses on aggregated levels such as inter-country mobility, with little attention paid to fine-grained institutional level, leading to a simplified spatial portrayal of the mobility. To fill the gap, we take scientists in geography as examples, and reconstructed their dynamic mobility network among institutions from 1970 to 2020 based on massive literature metadata. Our findings reveal the spatial mobility pattern that is now dominated by North America, Western and Northern Europe, East Asia, and Oceania, with the trend of intensification, multipolarity, and inequality over time. Specifically, the mobility network exhibits clear community structure largely constrained by spatial proximity and national borders. We also uncovered a universal downward mobility pattern embedded in the hierarchical structure. Our quantitative analysis further suggest that mobility is facilitated by multiple realities, including spatial, cultural, and scientific proximity, institutional rankings and national economic levels, cooperation, and visa-free policies, with varying dynamics. These results contribute to spatiotemporal insights into the mechanisms of scientific development in theory, and the basis for talent policymaking in practice. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",literature metadata; mobility pattern; science of science; Scientific mobility; spatiotemporal network,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,Article,2024,1,NA,English,10.1080/13658816.2024.2369540

However, how the results of this protocol of research can be applied in technology is seldom discussed. Here, I review the studies on time processing of the brain as examples of this research protocol, as well as two main application areas of neuroscience (neuroengineering and brain-inspired artificial intelligence). Time processing is a fundamental dimension of cognition, and time is also an indispensable dimension of any real-world signal to be processed in technology. Therefore, one may expect that the studies of time processing in cognition profoundly influence brain-related technology. Surprisingly, I found that the results from cognitive studies on timing processing are hardly helpful in solving practical problems. This awkward situation may be due to the lack of generalizability of the results of cognitive studies, which are under well-controlled laboratory conditions, to real-life situations. This lack of generalizability may be rooted in the fundamental unknowability of the world (including cognition). Overall, this paper questions and criticizes the usefulness and prospect of the abovementioned research protocol of cognitive neuroscience. I then give three suggestions for future research. First, to improve the generalizability of research, it is better to study brain activity under real-life conditions instead of in well-controlled laboratory experiments. Second, to overcome the unknowability of the world, we can engineer an easily accessible surrogate of the object under investigation, so that we can predict the behavior of the object under investigation by experimenting on the surrogate. Third, the paper calls for technology-oriented research, with the aim of technology creation instead of knowledge discovery. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Cognitive neuroscience; Generalizability; Metascience; Technology application; Unknowability,Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology,Book chapter,2024,0,NA,English,10.1007/978-3-031-60183-5_10

This systematic review and quantitative synthesis considers reporting of sociodemographic characteristics and sample composition in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology (now the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science) over the past 3 decades. Across k = 1,244 empirical studies, there were high and increasing rates of reporting of participant age/developmental stage and sex/gender, low but increasing reporting of socioeconomic status/income, and moderate and stable reporting of educational attainment. Rates of reporting of sexual orientation remained low and reporting of gender identity was essentially nonexistent. There were low to moderate but increasing rates of reporting of participant race and ethnicity. Approximately three-quarters of participants in studies over the past 3 decades were White, while the proportion of participants who were Asian, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic/Latino was much lower. Approximately two-thirds of participants were female, with this proportion increasing over time. There were also notable differences in the proportion of study participants as a function of race and sex/gender for different forms of psychopathology.

Despite valuable information obtained from these boluses, it remains common practice to use a single bolus (e.g., the worst score) to describe the degree of dysfunction. Researchers also often collapse continuous or ordinal swallowing measures into categories, potentially exacerbating information loss. These practices may adversely affect statistical power to detect and estimate smaller, yet potentially meaningful, treatment effects. This study sought to examine the impact of aggregating and categorizing penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) scores on statistical power and effect size estimates. We used a Monte Carlo approach to simulate three hypothetical within-subject treatment studies in Parkinson’s disease and head and neck cancer across a range of data characteristics (e.g., sample size, number of bolus trials, variability). Different statistical models (aggregated or multilevel) as well as various PAS reduction approaches (i.e., types of categorizations) were performed to examine their impact on power and the accuracy of effect size estimates. Across all scenarios, multilevel models demonstrated higher statistical power to detect group-level longitudinal change and more accurate estimates compared to aggregated (worst score) models. Categorizing PAS scores also reduced power and biased effect size estimates compared to an ordinal approach, though this depended on the type of categorization and baseline PAS distribution. Multilevel models should be considered as a more robust approach for the statistical analysis of multiple boluses administered in standardized swallowing protocols due to its high sensitivity and accuracy to compare group-level changes in swallowing function. Importantly, this finding appears to be consistent across patient populations with distinct pathophysiology (i.e., PD and HNC) and patterns of airway invasion. The decision to categorize a continuous or ordinal outcome should be grounded in the clinical or research question with recognition that scale reduction may negatively affect the quality of statistical inferences in certain scenarios. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Deglutition disorders; Dysphagia; Meta-science; Multilevel models; Statistics,Dysphagia,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1007/s00455-024-10738-7

Given current concerns regarding research standards, we were interested in how Spanish scholars perceived COVID-19 research and the extent to which questionable research practices and potentially problematic academic incentives are commonplace. We asked researchers to evaluate the expected quality of their COVID-19 projects and other peers’ research and compared these assessments with those from scholars not involved in COVID-19 research. We investigated self-admitting and estimated rates of questionable research practices and attitudes towards current research status. Responses from 131 researchers suggested that COVID-19 evaluations followed partisan lines, with scholars being more pessimistic about others’ colleagues’ research than their own. Additionally,researchers not involved in COVID-19 projects were more negative than their participating peers. These differences were particularly notable for areas such as the expected theoretical foundations or overall quality of the research, among others. Most Spanish scholars expected questionable research practices and inadequate incentives to be widespread. In these two aspects, researchers tended to agree regardless of their involvement in COVID-19 research. We provide specific recommendations for improving future meta-science studies, such as redefining QRPs as inadequate research practices (IRP). This change could help avoid key controversies regarding QRPs’ definition while highlighting their detrimental impact.

Nevertheless, its implementation faces multifaceted constraints. Through a meticulous inquiry, we methodically dissect the limitations of DI, encompassing: (a) susceptibility to variations in reference numbers, (b) vulnerability to intentional author manipulations, (c) heterogeneous manifestations across diverse subject fields, (d) disparities across publication years, (e) misalignment with established scientific impact measures, (f) inadequacy in convergent validity with expert-selected milestones, and (g) a prevalent concentration around zero in its distribution. Unveiling the root causes of these challenges, we propose a viable solution encapsulated in the Rescaled Disruption Index (RDI), achieved through comprehensive rescaling across fields, years, and references. Our empirical investigations unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of RDI, unveiling the universal nature of disruption distributions in science.

According to Kuhn's framework, a scientific revolution in a discipline is marked by the emergence of a new, dominant school of thought, which eclipses all the other theories. The aim of this study was to assess quantitatively if EP may be regarded as a ""scientific revolution"" sensu Kuhn. Method: I performed a bibliometric analysis of the prevalence of EP (broadly defined) in Psychology, and contrasted it with the prevalence of the socio-cultural approach, known as the Standard Social Science Model (SSSM) (Tooby & Cosmides, 1992). Results: My analysis reveals that the SSSM enjoys significantly greater prominence than EP and is growing at a swifter pace. My analysis also suggests that a “cultural evolutionary” approach, which integrates evolutionary and cross-cultural perspectives, is still underdeveloped. Conclusions: Despite being sympathetic to the claim that EP can potentially lead to a paradigm shift in the behavioral sciences, I argue that a prudent approach may involve recognizing the current state of affairs, envisioning realistic change, and building a more conceptually and methodologically heterogeneous research community in EP. © The Author(s) 2024.",Evolutionary psychology; Kuhn; Metascience; Paradigm; Scientific revolution; Standard social science model,Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology,Article,2024,3,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1007/s40750-024-00234-5

This study analyzes the historical evolution of policy documents such as science and technology planning, strategic guidelines and research reports issued by the U.S. government and the long-term R&D input data of the federal government in the past two decades, with a view to revealing the development and evolution characteristics of the U.S. science and technology policy, and thus providing a certain explanation for the relative decline of the U.S. science and technology leading position. It shows that the relative decline of the United States’ global leadership in science and technology is closely related to the relatively stable development of science and technology policies, the weakening of strategic leadership of major science and technology plans, the year-on-year decline of government R&D investment intensity and the decline of emphasis on frontier basic research. This has important implications for China’s scientific and technological development: scientific and technological development is not only a long-term strategic undertaking, but also a highly competitive undertaking.

Taking the more tenable position of cautious adaptation, this paper argues that there exists a taxonomy in the structure of scientific papers, and that language models can be used by scientific researchers to bootstrap scientific writing. Furthermore, AI can augment their own writing workflow to more efficiently traverse the academic publishing pipeline. Despite the shortcomings of language models, e.g., hallucination, when prompted appropriately with sufficient constraints, language models are extremely accurate and efficient content providers. In this work, the canonical scientific paper is broken down into its taxonomy of parts, where it is then considered how each part can benefit from language models, e.g., in generating abstracts and keywords, reformatting sections, theorizing titles, etc. Finally, a call for consensus among the academic and scientific communities regarding the use of language models in the scientific writing workflow is established. © 2024 IEEE.",academia; GPT; language model; literature review; metascience; scientific workflow system; scientific writing,"Proceedings - 2024 Conference on AI, Science, Engineering, and Technology, AIxSET 2024",Conference paper,2024,0,NA,English,10.1109/AIxSET62544.2024.00028

Standard analytic techniques do not account for the fact that dyads are not generally independent of one another. That is, when dyads share a constituent member (e.g., a common country), they may be statistically dependent, or clustered. Recent work has developed dyadic clustering robust standard errors (DCRSEs) that account for this dependence. Using these DCRSEs, we reanalyzed all empirical articles published in International Organization between January 2014 and January 2020 that feature dyadic data. We find that published standard errors for key explanatory variables are, on average, approximately half as large as DCRSEs, suggesting that dyadic clustering is leading researchers to severely underestimate uncertainty. However, most (67% of) statistically significant findings remain statistically significant when using DCRSEs. We conclude that accounting for dyadic clustering is both important and feasible, and offer software in R and Stata to facilitate use of DCRSEs in future research.  © The Author(s), 2023.",dyadic data; meta-science; robust standard errors,Political Analysis,Article,2024,1,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1017/pan.2023.26

Riccio G.E.,59538275100,"Nascent Science Technology, LLC, Philippines",Toward Risk-Informed Decision Making in Situated Systems Medicine: Metascience for SmartHomes on Earth and in Space,"A fundamental premise of this book is that medical care for spaceflight must consider the needs of the mission as well as the needs of individual astronauts. New-to-the-world systems of technology, processes, and people must be developed and operated for missions to destinations where no one has gone before. A focus on systems in health and performance (i.e., situated systems medicine) thus follows from this premise. Situated systems medicine is not the starting point for an endeavor that is merely more inclusive or more interdisciplinary. It is a means to achieve specific mission outcomes. The comprehensively explicit structure of spaceflight missions — life and work in space — makes systems medicine feasible. This definitive structure bounds the problem for scientists and engineers who must develop unprecedented capabilities. One need not assume that systems medicine is inherently more complex than any other approach to medicine or other aspects of spaceflight. The considerations are just different. As in any other field of endeavor, developers and practitioners of systems medicine decide what kind and level of detail to consider. While this claim may be controversial, it is a working assumption in this chapter. © 2024 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

Following psychology’s recent replication crisis, we assessed the prevalence of one type of replication contribution: direct replication articles—articles where a direct or close replication of a previously published study is one of the main contributions of the article. This prevalence provides one indicator of how much the field values and incentivizes this type of self-correction. We used a keyword search combined with manual checking to identify direct replication articles that were published from 2010 to 2021 in the 100 highest impact psychology journals. In total, only 0.2% of articles (169 articles out of 84,834) were direct replication articles. There was a small suggestive increase in the prevalence of direct replication articles over time. Additionally, journals with a stated policy of considering replication submissions (31% of journals) were 7.85 times more likely to publish direct replication articles than those without such a policy. Fifty-four out of 88 journals did not publish any direct replication articles in the 11 years surveyed. Our estimate is not the same as the prevalence of direct replication studies overall (direct replication results can be shared in many ways other than as direct replication articles in top journals). Ultimately, direct replication articles are still rare, with a few journals doing most of the heavy lifting. Based on these findings, we argue it would be premature to declare that psychology’s replication crisis is over. © 2024 American Psychological Association",direct replication; metascience; psychology; replication crisis; self-correction,American Psychologist,Article,2024,1,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1037/amp0001385

However, the discourse on open science is heavily influenced by certain research fields and paradigms, leading to the risk of generalizing what counts as openness to other research fields, regardless of its applicability. In our paper, we provide evidence that researchers perceive different profiles in the potential to apply open science practices to their projects, making a one-size-fits-all approach unsuitable. In a pilot study, we first systematized the breadth of open science practices. The subsequent survey study examined the perceived applicability of 13 open science practices across completed research projects in a broad variety of research disciplines. We were able to identify four different profiles in the perceived applicability of open science practices. For researchers conducting qualitative-empirical research projects, comprehensively implementing the breadth of open science practices is tendentially not feasible. Further, research projects from some disciplines tended to fit a profile with little opportunity for public participation. Yet, disciplines and research paradigms appear not to be the key factors in predicting the perceived applicability of open science practices. Our findings underscore the case for considering project-related conditions when implementing open science practices. This has implications for the establishment of policies, guidelines and standards concerning open science. © 2024 The Authors.

This means identifying and formulating key meta-problems, creating a special meta-language, developing meta-theories, and obtaining non-trivial results, at least at the level of meta-classifications. The history of meta-anthropology, summarized in the article, shows that only the first three steps have been taken along this long path. These include the creation and justification of the term, the choice of a higher-level theory for constructing the theory of the discipline (world hypotheses and root metaphors), and the proposal of a normative model. The whole process entails a transformation of the whole anthropology due to the anthropologists’ transition from thinking/thought to meta-thinking/meta-thought. We will try to show that the meta-level of analysis is useful for anthropology, generates new knowledge and ideas, and unites different areas of anthropology.

Much of the process of acquiring research funding, however, belongs to the less favourite duties of many researchers: It is time consuming, often stressful and, in the majority of cases, unsuccessful. This resentment towards funding acquisition is backed up by empirical research: The current system to distribute research funding, via competitive calls for extensive research applications that undergo peer review, has repeatedly been shown to fail in its task to reliably rank proposals according to their merit, while at the same time being highly inefficient. The simplest, fairest and broadly supported alternative would be to distribute funding more equally across researchers, for example, by an increase of universities' base funding, thereby saving considerable time that can be spent on research instead.

This study aims to explore the knowledge map of TRT. Methods: In this bibliometric study, we searched Scopus for relevant keywords from the beginning to 2023. Our inclusion criteria were original articles and reviews and our exclusion criteria were non-English and non-related articles and document types other than original articles and reviews. Excel, VOS viewer, and Science of Science (Sci2) software were used for data synthesis. Results: From 6712 retrieved articles, 5325 articles were included for analysis. The most productivity belonged to the USA (n=2, 570 documents), the United Kingdom (n=476), and Italy (n=339). “Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism” (n=168) had the highest participation in publishing. Also, “Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism” and the “Journal of Sexual Medicine” exhibited significant bibliographic coupling with other journals in the TRT field. The research topics of interest were mainly related to hypogonadism, prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction. Bursting analysis of the title and abstract revealed the TRT research prior to the year 2000 was mainly focused on castration, gonadectomy, growth, and aplastic anemia, while the focus of recent research moved towards libido, cardiovascular events, HIV, geriatric issues, diabetes, bipolar disorder, cancer, transmasculine, and transgender individuals. Conclusion: This study highlights the growing trend of TRT research over time, with most focus on hypogonadism, prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction.

Here, we reveal its presence and underlying mechanisms in pairwise scientific collaboration by reconstructing the publication histories of 560,689 individual scientists and 1,026,196 pairs of scientists. We quantify pair synergy by extracting the non-additive effects of collaboration on scientific impact, which are not confounded by prior collaboration experience or luck. We employ a network inference methodology with the stochastic block model to investigate the mechanism of pair synergy and its connection to individual attributes. The inferred block structure, derived solely from the observed types of synergy, can anticipate an undetermined type of synergy between two scientists who have never collaborated. This suggests that synergy arises from a suitable combination of certain, yet unidentified, individual characteristics. Furthermore, the most relevant to pair synergy is research interest, although its diversity does not lead to complementarity across all disciplines.

Methods: Philosophical analysis is used through constructing and deconstructing concepts of the film. Louis Althusser's theory of ideology is applied in this research paper to better comprehend how ideology affects the dynamics of power and social institutions. Additionally, the recorded records from the archives of the liberation of Algeria are utilised. Results: Althusser's notion of social formation, as a construction, is presented as a construction emerging from roles and central positions. This moving away from the egocentric vision, with no regulating concept, no starting seed, no united whole contradicted to the use of ideology as seeking for completion and wholeness. In brief, despite attempts to utilize what they claim to be scientific knowledge, the endeavor to harness these possibilities led to new technological and scientific analysis. However, its utilization within the framework of state apparatus ideology and social formation bifurcated the film into two levels: film analysis and post-film analysis.

The first question we address is the composition of what is commonly labeled AI, and how the various subfields within this domain are linked together. We reconstruct the internal structure of the AI ecosystem through the co-occurrence of AI terms in publications, and we distinguish between 15 different specialties of AI. Furthermore, we investigate the spreading of AI outside its native disciplines. We bring to light the dynamics of the diffusion of AI in the scientific ecosystem and we describe the disciplinary landscape of AI applications. Finally we analyze the role of collaborations for the interdisciplinary spreading of AI.

Although the patent system was established to safeguard innovation, previous research implies that disruptive innovation faces stronger challenges in gaining recognition. To open the black box of scientific gatekeeping, we analyze the dataset of the US Patent and Trademark Office between 2004 and 2018. Findings show that disruptive innovation is detrimental to patent approval, whereas examiner workload and work experience can enhance it. Moreover, examiner workload mitigates the negative impact of disruptive innovation on patent approval, while examiner work experience can amplify the impact of examiner workload on patent approval. This study contributes to the science of science by unveiling the seemingly contradictory gatekeeping logic of patent examiners. The implications help design a more innovation- friendly incentive mechanism for scientific gatekeeping. © 2024 Copyright 2024 for this paper by its authors.",disruption innovation; examiner work experience; examiner workload; scientific gatekeeping,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,Conference paper,2024,1,NA,English,NA

I focus on the oft-expressed concern: will reliance on natural experiments prevent historically-oriented social scientists from asking “big” or theoretically important questions that may not be causally identified? With a brief intellectual history, I argue that in HPE natural experiments have proven perfectly compatible with answering major questions in the field and both deductive and inductive theory-building. The biggest problems have arisen from more practical issues of meta-science; I focus on tendencies to over-claim exogeneity and to understate uncertainty. I discuss how APD might fruitfully incorporate natural experiments into its methodological toolkit while avoiding some of these problems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",American political development; Historical political economy; Natural experiments,Studies in Public Choice,Book chapter,2024,0,NA,English,10.1007/978-3-031-74913-1_16

Central to the study of SciSci has been the analysis of citation networks. Here, two prominent modeling methodologies have been employed: one is to assess the citation impact dynamics of papers using parametric distributions, and the other is to embed the citation networks in a latent space optimal for characterizing the static relations between papers in terms of their citations. Interestingly, citation networks are a prominent example of single-event dynamic networks, i.e., networks for which each dyad only has a single event (i.e., the point in time of citation). We presently propose a novel likelihood function for the characterization of such single-event networks. Using this likelihood, we propose the Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding model (DISEE). The DISEE model characterizes the scientific interactions in terms of a latent distance model in which random effects account for citation heterogeneity while the time-varying impact is characterized using existing parametric representations for assessment of dynamic impact. We highlight the proposed approach on several real citation networks finding that the DISEE well reconciles static latent distance network embedding approaches with classical dynamic impact assessments.

A representation of reference accuracy is often expressed as an error rate which is the percentage of citations with at least one error within a reference list. The purpose of this study was to describe the reference accuracy of peer-reviewed, primary studies about reference accuracy. The articles selected were a total of 105 studies included in a previously published scoping review about reference accuracy. A total of 1,486 references were verified across included studies. The overall error rate was 21.2%. Author names and article titles were the most common error types. The reported 21.2% error rate is lower than the 32.7% error rate of general reference accuracy literature reported in the scoping review. It remains unclear why authors who conduct empirical studies about reference accuracy still struggle with the issue. It is possible that all scholars, including those who study reference accuracy, are simply not good at creating accurate citations. Or, perhaps there are systemic reasons for this phenomenon that are an interaction of many factors or beyond anyone’s control.

Leverage Points the way,"Sport and sports research are inherently complex systems. This appears to be somewhat at odds with the current research paradigm in sport in which interventions are aimed are fixing or solving singular broken components within the system. In any complex system, such as sport, there are places where we can intervene to change behaviour and, ideally, system outcomes. Meadows influential work describes 12 different points with which to intervene in complex systems (termed “Leverage Points”), which are ordered from shallow to deeper based on their potential effectiveness to influence transformational change. Whether research in sport is aimed at shallow or deeper Leverage Points is unknown. This study aimed to assess highly impactful research in sports science, sports nutrition/metabolism, sports medicine, sport and exercise psychology, sports management, motor control, sports biomechanics and sports policy/law through a Leverage Points lens. The 10 most highly cited original-research manuscripts from each journal representing these fields were analysed for the Leverage Point with which the intervention described in the manuscript was focused. The results indicate that highly impactful research in sports science, sports nutrition/metabolism, sports biomechanics and sports medicine is predominantly focused at the shallow end of the Leverage Points hierarchy. Conversely, the interventions drawn from journals representing sports management and sports policy/law were focused on the deeper end. Other journals analysed had a mixed profile. Explanations for these findings include the dual practitioner/academic needing to “think fast” to solve immediate questions in sports science/medicine/nutrition, limited engagement with “working slow” systems and method experts and differences in incremental vs. non-incremental research strategies. © 2024 The Author(s).

Seven previous meta-studies have all reported evidence of external focus superiority. The most comprehensive of these concluded that an external focus enhances motor skill retention, transfer, and performance and leads to reduced eletromyographic activity during performance and that more distal external foci are superior to proximal external foci for performance. Here, we reanalyzed these data using robust Bayesian meta-analyses that included several plausible models of publication bias. We found moderate to strong evidence of publication bias for all analyses. After correcting for publication bias, estimated mean effects were negligible: g = 0.01 (performance), g = 0.15 (retention), g = 0.09 (transfer), g = 0.06 (electromyography), and g = −0.01 (distance effect). Bayes factors indicated data favored the null for each analysis, ranging from BF01 = 1.3 (retention) to 5.75 (performance). We found clear evidence of heterogeneity in each analysis, suggesting the impact of attentional focus depends on yet unknown contextual factors. Our results contradict the existing consensus that an external focus is always more effective than an internal focus. Instead, focus of attention appears to have a variety of effects that we cannot account for, and, on average, those effects are small to nil. These results parallel previous metascience suggesting publication bias has obfuscated the motor learning literature. © (2024), (American Psychological Association).

Similarly, a large proportion of authors are based in North America. This imbalance is well-documented across a range of subfields in psychology, yet the specific steps and best practices to bridge publication and data gaps across world regions are still unclear. To address this issue, we conducted a hackathon at the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science 2021 conference to develop guidelines to improve international representation of authors and participants, adapted for various stakeholders in the production of psychological knowledge. Based on this hackathon, we discuss specific guidelines and practices that funding bodies, academic institutions, professional academic societies, journal editors and reviewers, and researchers should engage with to ensure psychology is the scientific discipline of human behavior and cognition across the world.

Our approach is cohort-based and longitudinal: We track individual male and female scientists over time and quantify the phenomenon traditionally referred to as “leaving science.” Using publication metadata from Scopus—a global bibliometric database of publications and citations—we follow the details of the publishing careers of scientists from 38 OECD countries who started publishing in 2000 (N = 142,776) and 2010 (N = 232,843). Our study is restricted to 16 STEMM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine), and we track the individual scholarly output of the two cohorts until 2022. We use survival analysis to compare attrition of men and women scientists. With more women in science and more women within cohorts, attrition is becoming ever less gendered. In addition to the combined aggregated changes at the level of all STEMM disciplines, widely nuanced changes were found to occur at the discipline level and over time. Attrition in science means different things for men versus women depending on the discipline; moreover, it means different things for scientists from different cohorts entering the scientific workforce. Finally, global bibliometric datasets were tested in the current study, opening new opportunities to explore gender and disciplinary differences in attrition. © The Author(s) 2024.",Academic careers; Attrition and retention; Big data; Kaplan‒Meier curves; Leaving science; Science of science; Survival analysis,Higher Education,Article,2024,5,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1007/s10734-024-01284-0

Similarly, as Computational Social Science (CSS) grows up, it must strike a balance between its own practices and those of neighboring disciplines to achieve scientific rigor and refine its identity. However, there are certain areas within CSS that are reluctant to adopt rigorous scientific practices from other fields, which can be observed through an overreliance on passively collected data (e.g., through digital traces, wearables) without questioning the validity of such data. This paper argues that CSS should embrace the potential of combining both passive and active measurement practices to capitalize on the strengths of each approach, including objectivity and psychological quality. Additionally, the paper suggests that CSS would benefit from integrating practices and knowledge from other established disciplines, such as measurement validation, theoretical embedding, and open science practices.

The focus of this paper is on the rhetoric of psychological measurement and validity scholarship, in both the theoretical and methodological and empirical literatures. We examine various discourse practices in published psychological measurement and validity literature, including: (a) clear instances of rhetoric (i.e., persuasion or performance); (b) common or rote expressions and tropes (e.g., perfunctory claims or declarations); (c) metaphors and other “literary” styles; and (d) ambiguous, confusing, or unjustifiable claims. The methodological approach we use is informed by a combination of conceptual analysis and exploratory grounded theory, the latter of which we used to identify relevant themes within the published psychological discourse. Examples of both constructive and useful or misleading and potentially harmful discourse practices will be given.

Although attention has been paid to the possibility of heterogeneous populations driving replication success/failure, the heterogeneous recruitment strategies researchers use to draw samples from those populations are often overlooked. Yet recruitment strategies may bias the participants who show up and shape replication results. We examine this idea through several unique paradigms (sampling North American university students, Ntotal = 1,009). First, subtle manipulations of recruitment strategies (i.e., mentioning cash, expedient credit, fun, or a study narrative) were differentially appealing to individuals varying on experiential versus reward-based motivations (Experiment 1). Second, employing different recruitment strategies biased the motivational styles of actual participant show-ups, and sometimes even shaped the success of several replication studies (Experiment 2–3). We conclude that recruitment strategies may sometimes alter the degree of successful replication. © The Author(s) 2024.",materialism; metascience; recruitment; replication,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1177/01461672241293504

Knowledge about how scientific advances support marketplace inventions is therefore essential for understanding the role of science in propelling real-world applications and technological progress. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets tracing scientific publications and patented inventions and the complex interactions among them offers us new opportunities to explore the evolving dual frontiers of science and technology at an unprecedented level of scale and detail. However, we lack suitable visual analytics approaches to analyze such complex interactions effectively. Here we introduce InnovationInsights, an interactive visual analysis system for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to explore the complex linkages between science and technology, and to identify critical innovations, inventors, and potential partners. The system first identifies important associations between scientific papers and patented inventions through a set of statistical measures introduced by our experts from the field of the Science of Science. A series of visualization views are then used to present these associations in the data context. In particular, we introduce the Interplay Graph to visualize patterns and insights derived from the data, helping users effectively navigate citation relationships between papers and patents. This visualization thereby helps them identify the origins of technical inventions and the impact of scientific research. We evaluate the system through two case studies with experts followed by expert interviews. We further engage a premier research institution to test-run the system, helping its institution leaders to extract new insights for innovation. Through both the case studies and the engagement project, we find that our system not only meets our original goals of design, allowing users to better identify the sources of technical inventions and to understand the broad impact of scientific research; it also goes beyond these purposes to enable an array of new applications for researchers and research institutions, ranging from identifying untapped innovation potential within an institution to forging new collaboration opportunities between science and industry. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",Academic Profiles; Innovation; Patent Data; Publication Data; Science of Science; Visual Analytics,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327387

Modelling insights on the persistence of spurious science,"The reality that volumes of published biomedical research are not reproducible is an increasingly recognized problem. Spurious results reduce trustworthiness of reported science, increasing research waste. While science should be self-correcting from a philosophical perspective, that in insolation yields no information on efforts required to nullify suspect findings or factors shaping how quickly science may be corrected. There is also a paucity of information on how perverse incentives in the publishing ecosystem favouring novel positive findings over null results shape the ability of published science to self-correct. Knowledge of factors shaping self-correction of science remain obscure, limiting our ability to mitigate harms. This modelling study introduces a simple model to capture dynamics of the publication ecosystem, exploring factors influencing research waste, trustworthiness, corrective effort and time to correction. Results from this work indicate that research waste and corrective effort are highly dependent on field-specific false positive rates and time delays to corrective results to spurious findings are propagated. The model also suggests conditions under which biomedical science is self-correcting and those under which publication of correctives alone cannot stem propagation of untrustworthy results. Finally, this work models a variety of potential mitigation strategies, including researcher- and publisher-driven interventions. © 2024 The Authors.

In this article, after briefly critiquing a recently published defense of preregistration mandates, I propose a three-part vision for cultivating a robust and cumulative psychological science. First, we must know how to produce robust rather than fragile findings. Key ingredients include sufficient sample sizes, valid measurement, and honesty/transparency. Second, we must know how to identify robust (and non-robust) findings. To this end, I reframe robustness checks broadly into four types: across analytic decisions, across measures, across samples, and across investigative teams. Third, we must be motivated to produce and care about robust science. This aim requires marshaling sociocultural forces to support, reward, and celebrate the production of robust findings, just as we once rewarded flashy but fragile findings. Critically, these sociocultural reinforcements must be tied as closely as possible to rigor and robustness themselves—rather than cosmetic indicators of rigor and robustness, as we have done in the past. © The Author(s) 2024.",metascience; open science; preregistration badges; psychological science; replication crisis; robust science; transparency,Assessment,Article,2024,0,NA,English,10.1177/10731911241299723

Yet the timing of when interdisciplinary research achieves its highest citation impact remains unclear. Here, we use the time of a paper to reach its citation peak to quantify citation dynamics, and examine its relationship with paper interdisciplinarity. Using large scale publication datasets spanning over 37 years, our results suggest that interdisciplinary papers show significant delayed citation impact both at the individual paper level and collectively, as it takes longer for highly interdisciplinary papers to reach their citation peak as well as their half citations. Such relationships are nearly universal across various scientific disciplines and time periods. Furthermore, we study the underlying forces behind this delayed impact, finding that the effect goes beyond the Matthew effect (i.e., the rich-get-richer effect). Although team size and content conventionality are partly related to the citation delay, they cannot fully explain this effect. Overall, our results suggest that governments, research administrators, and funding agencies should be aware of this general feature of interdisciplinary science, which may have broad policy implications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Citation peak; Delayed citation impact; Interdisciplinary research; Science of science; The Matthew effect,Journal of Informetrics,Article,2024,11,NA,English,10.1016/j.joi.2023.101468

This almost exclusive predominance of science and technology in the 19th century presupposes an empirical-naturalist and positivist model. The methodology is based on a hermeneutic analysis of the memories and scientific reports of two European expeditions to the southern South of America, from which the essential topics of a narrow vision of unified science are criticized. The main results of this project assume the distinction between natural and social sciences, discussed on the basis of phenomenology and hermeneutics. This critique allows clarifying the empirical-rationalist matrix that is defined by the expansion of the idea of the natural world as defined by 19th-century European science, which degrades and delegitimizes the knowledge of the worlds and of the peoples of the sea that inhabit the confines of Tierra del Fuego. It is concluded that re-examining this notion of science is a pressing issue for the intercultural revision of the idea of the world and a sustainable planet. © 2024.

Sociologists of religion suggest that this neglect can be explained by the unusual irreligiosity of academia. However, some are hopeful that changes to graduate training and other institutional interventions can overcome this propensity and encourage more sociological engagement with religion, one of the most influential forces in contemporary society. Drawing on a new dataset of 473 sociology graduate students in the top 25 departments in the United States, we assess how personal secularity and departmental support for religious inquiry predict sociological engagement with religion. Personal secularity is a strong predictor of the decision to study religion and of the overall perception of the relevance of religion in contemporary society. Coming from a department where religion is discussed and faculty pursue research on religion predicts the perception of religion’s relevance for the secular majority.

Recently, Ellipse of Insignificance (EOI) analysis was introduced as a tool to allow researchers to gauge the robustness of reported results in dichotomous outcome design trials, giving precise deterministic values for the degree of miscoding between events and non-events tolerable simultaneously in both control and experimental arms (Grimes, 2022). While this is useful for situations where potential miscoding might transpire, it does not account for situations where apparently significant findings might result from accidental or deliberate data redaction in either the control or experimental arms of an experiment, or from missing data or systematic redaction. To address these scenarios, we introduce Region of Attainable Redaction (ROAR), a tool that extends EOI analysis to account for situations of potential data redaction. This produces a bounded cubic curve rather than an ellipse, and we outline how this can be used to identify potential redaction through an approach analogous to EOI. Applications are illustrated, and source code, including a web-based implementation that performs EOI and ROAR analysis in tandem for dichotomous outcome trials is provided. © 2024, Grimes.",epidemiology; global health; metaresearch; metascience; none; replicability; statistics; sustainability; tools,eLife,Article,2024,1,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.7554/eLife.93050

We direct our attention to the non-segregated and highly segregated communities, quantifying and comparing their structural topologies and k-core positions. When considering communities of both categories (controlling for size), our results show no differences in density and clustering but substantial variability in the core position. Larger non-segregated communities are more likely to occupy cores near the network nucleus, while the highly segregated ones tend to be closer to the network periphery. Finally, we analyse differences in citations gained by researchers within communities of different segregation categories. Researchers in highly segregated communities get more citations from their community members in middle cores and gain more citations per publication in middle/periphery cores. Those in non-segregated communities get more citations per publication in the nucleus. To our knowledge, this work is the first to characterise community segregation in co-authorship networks and investigate the relationship between community segregation and author citations. Our results help study highly segregated communities of scientific co-authors and can pave the way for intervention strategies to improve the growth and dissemination of scientific knowledge. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.",Co-authorship networks; k-core decomposition; Science of science; Segregation analysis,EPJ Data Science,Article,2023,2,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00411-8

In the last decade, more attention has been paid to non-pharmacological or non-psychological therapies for PTSD, including neurofeedback (NFB). NFB is a promising non-invasive technique targeting specific brainwave patterns associated with psychiatric symptomatology. By learning to regulate brain activity in a closed-loop paradigm, individuals can improve their functionality while reducing symptom severity. However, owing to its lax regulation and heterogeneous legal status across different countries, the degree to which it has scientific support as a psychiatric treatment remains controversial. In this state-of-the-art review, we searched PubMed, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, Scopus, and MEDLINE and identified meta-analyses and systematic reviews exploring the efficacy of NFB for PTSD. We included seven systematic reviews, out of which three included meta-analyses (32 studies and 669 participants) that targeted NFB as an intervention while addressing a single condition—PTSD. We used the MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 and the criteria described by Cristea and Naudet (Behav Res Therapy 123:103479, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2019.103479) to identify sources of research waste and increasing value in biomedical research. The seven assessed reviews had an overall extremely poor quality score (5 critically low, one low, one moderate, and none high) and multiple sources of waste while opening opportunities for increasing value in the NFB literature. Our research shows that it remains unclear whether NFB training is significantly beneficial in treating PTSD. The quality of the investigated literature is low and maintains a persistent uncertainty over numerous points, which are highly important for deciding whether an intervention has clinical efficacy. Just as importantly, none of the reviews we appraised explored the statistical power, referred to open data of the included studies, or adjusted their pooled effect sizes for publication bias and risk of bias. Based on the obtained results, we identified some recurrent sources of waste (such as a lack of research decisions based on sound questions or using an appropriate methodology in a fully transparent, unbiased, and useable manner) and proposed some directions for increasing value (homogeneity and consensus) in designing and reporting research on NFB interventions in PTSD. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Metascience; Neurofeedback; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Research waste; Review,Applied Psychophysiology Biofeedback,Review,2024,3,NA,English,10.1007/s10484-023-09610-5

At the same time, funding and institutional arrangements, as well as scientific and political cultures, affect the structure of collaboration networks. Since such arrangements and cultures differ across regions in the world in systematic ways, we surmise that collaboration networks and impact should also differ systematically across regions. To test this, we compare the structure of collaboration networks among prominent researchers in North America and Europe. We find that prominent researchers in Europe establish denser collaboration networks, whereas those in North America establish more decentralized networks. We also find that the impact of the publications of prominent researchers in North America is significantly higher than for those in Europe, both when they collaborate with other prominent researchers and when they do not. Although Europeans collaborate with other prominent researchers more often, which increases their impact, we also find that repeated collaboration among prominent researchers decreases the synergistic effect of collaborating. © 2023, The Author(s).",Collaboration networks; Complex networks; Computational social science; Research impact; Science of science,EPJ Data Science,Article,2023,5,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00378-6

In this paper, we propose a novel research topic, that is, how to detect anomalous citations. To be specific, we first define anomalous citations and propose a unified framework, named ACTION, to detect anomalous citations in a heterogeneous academic network. ACTION is established based on non-negative matrix factorization and network representation learning, which considers not only the relevance of citation contents but also the relationships among academic entities including journals, papers, and authors. To evaluate the performance of ACTION, we construct three anomalous citation datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

First, we review existing data and present some new data to highlight the scope of the White = neutral framework. Second, we integrate research from across psychological science to argue that the continued use of the White = neutral framework will prevent psychology from becoming a truly objective and inclusive science for at least three reasons: (a) Research with White samples will be valued over research with samples of color, (b) norms that maintain White neutrality will remain unchallenged, and (c) the role of White identity in psychological processes will remain underspecified and underexamined. Third, we provide recommendations for how to move beyond the White = neutral framework in hopes of encouraging all psychological scientists to move toward a White ≠ neutral framework in which all samples are identified for the unique and diverse perspectives that they bring to the world. © The Author(s) 2022.",archival analysis; metascience; racial inequality; racial modifiers,Perspectives on Psychological Science,Article,2023,60,NA,English,10.1177/17456916221077117

The study found that Clarivate Analytics and Elsevier offer highly versatile APIs, while non-profit organizations, such as OpenCitations and OurResearch promote the Open Science philosophy. Most organizations offer free access to APIs for non-commercial purposes, but some have limitations on metadata retrieval. However, CrossRef, OpenCitations, or OpenAlex have no restrictions on the metadata retrieval. Co-author analysis using author names and bibliometric evaluation using citations are the types of analyses that can be done with the data provided by most APIs.

Prior work tends to focus on whole cultural products, such as patents and articles, and emphasizes external social factors as important. This article focuses on concepts as reflections of ideas, and we identify the combined influence that social factors and internal intellectual structures have on ideational diffusion. To develop this perspective, we use computational techniques to identify nearly 60,000 new ideas introduced over two decades (1993 to 2016) in the Web of Science and follow their diffusion across 38 million later publications. We find new ideas diffuse more widely when they socially and intellectually resonate. New ideas become core concepts of science when they reach expansive networks of unrelated authors, achieve consistent intellectual usage, are associated with other prominent ideas, and fit with extant research traditions. These ecological conditions play an increasingly decisive role later in an idea’s career, after their relations with the environment are established. This work advances the systematic study of scientific ideas by moving beyond products to focus on the content of ideas themselves and applies a relational perspective that takes seriously the contingency of their success. © American Sociological Association 2023.",diffusion; innovation; science of science; sociology of ideas; sociology of knowledge; sociology of science,American Sociological Review,Article,2023,11,NA,English,10.1177/00031224231166955

Knowledge management practices foster the growth of small businesses. They allow innovation to grow within the institutions, enhance customer satisfaction and reduce employee absenteeism and attrition. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a bibliometric protocol to retrieve the 686 articles published in the Web of Science (WoS) database. The WoS database is selected to ensure only quality and peer-reviewed publications are analysed in the study. It then identifies the top contributions, and existing thematic areas, and suggests future research and policy actions for boosting economic growth through small business. The study uses VOSviewer, Science of Science (Sci2) and Gephi to conduct the bibliometric and network analysis. Findings: The results from keyword co-occurrence and co-citation analysis helps in identifying thematic areas. The findings highlight that there exist five major themes in knowledge management research for small businesses. The dynamic co-citation analysis helps in tracing the evolution of these clusters and suggests future themes, research directions and methodological advances in the theme. PageRank analysis helps in identifying the top articles published on high-impact journals in the theme. Research limitations/implications: The study helps researchers by summarising existing literature and identifying key thematic areas. It also assists policymakers by recommending actions to improve knowledge management practises in small businesses to gain a competitive advantage.

This is often explained by numerous epistemological, ethical and pragmatic issues concerning qualitative data types. In this article, I provide an alternative to the frequently expressed, often reasonable, concerns regarding the sharing of qualitative human data by highlighting three advantages of qualitative data sharing. I argue that sharing qualitative human data is not by default ‘less ethical’, ‘riskier’ and ‘impractical’ compared with quantitative data sharing, but in some cases more ethical, less risky and easier to manage for sharing because (1) informed consent can be discussed, negotiated and validated; (2) the shared data can be curated by special means; and (3) the privacy risks are mainly local instead of global. I hope this alternative perspective further encourages qualitative psychologists to share their data when it is epistemologically, ethically and pragmatically possible. © 2022 The Authors.

Considering the tight link between consciousness and moral status, answers to these questions have implications for law and ethics. Here we point out that given this link, the scientific community studying consciousness may face implicit pressure to carry out certain research programs or interpret results in ways that justify current norms rather than challenge them. We show that because consciousness largely determines moral status, the use of nonhuman animals in the scientific study of consciousness introduces a direct conflict between scientific relevance and ethics—the more scientifically valuable an animal model is for studying consciousness, the more difficult it becomes to ethically justify compromises to its well-being for consciousness research. Finally, in light of these considerations, we call for a discussion of the immediate ethical corollaries of the body of knowledge that has accumulated and for a more explicit consideration of the role of ideology and ethics in the scientific study of consciousness. © The Author(s) 2022.",allied field: philosophy; application: policy; comparative psychology; consciousness; ethics; metascience,Perspectives on Psychological Science,Article,2023,9,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1177/17456916221110222
Munger K.,7006292298,"Political Science, Penn State University, United States",Temporal validity as meta-science,"The “credibility revolution” has forced quantitative social scientists to confront the limits of our methods for creating general knowledge. As a result, many practitioners aim to generate valid but local knowledge and then synthesize and apply that knowledge to predict what will happen in a target context. Positivist social science has until recently been hamstrung with other, more immediate threats to validity and inference, but I argue that recent advances in statistical approaches to the problem of external validity reveal limits of the current paradigm. This article and the term “temporal validity” illustrate the intrinsic limits of agnostic (i.e., assumption-free) external validity when the target setting is in the future. These limits, I argue, suggest a re-orientation of social science methodology. We should acknowledge that no research design, no empirical knowledge, is perfectible; instead, we should explicitly aim to increase the amount and quality of knowledge we produce. I believe it is useful to characterize this perspective as part of “Meta-Science,” an emerging paradigm within the social sciences. “Temporal validity” and the implied “knowledge decay” thus represent a meta-scientific intervention aimed at increasing the usefulness of the knowledge we produce. Among other structural reforms, I argue that the binary reality of academic scholarship (a paper is published or not) reifies the perfectibility of empirical knowledge and is thus an impediment to recognizing the continuous nature of all forms of scientific validity. © The Author(s) 2023.",external validity; meta-science; social media; Temporal validity,Research and Politics,Article,2023,10,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1177/20531680231187271

We argue that as a field, we must reckon with the concerns brought to light during this critical decade. How the field responds to this crisis will reveal our commitment to self-correction. If we do not take the steps necessary to address our problems and simply declare the crisis to be over or the problems to be fixed without evidence, we risk further undermining our credibility. To fully reckon with this crisis, we must empirically assess the state of the field to take stock of how credible our science actually is and whether it is improving. We propose an agenda for metascientific research, and we review approaches to empirically evaluate and track where we are as a field (e.g., analyzing the published literature, surveying researchers). We describe one such project (Surveying the Past and Present State of Published Studies in Social and Personality Psychology) underway in our research group.

This paints the picture of a general growth of scientific and technical capabilities of nations induced by the spreading of information typical of the scientific environment. Shifting the focus of the analysis to the regional level, we find that even developed nations display a considerable level of inequality in the Scientific Fitness of their internal regions. Further, we assess comparatively how the competitiveness of each geographic region is distributed over the spectrum of research sectors.

We show why fitting a model that preserves the total sum of a vector can be beneficial in the case of heavy-tailed data that are frequently observed in informetrics and similar disciplines. Based on this observation, we introduce the reparameterised versions of the discrete generalised beta distribution (DGBD) and power law models that preserve the total sum of elements in a citation vector and, as a byproduct, they enjoy much better predictive power when predicting many bibliometric indices as well as partial cumulative sums. This also results in the underlying model parameters' being easier to fit numerically. Moreover, they are also more interpretable. Namely, just like in our recently-introduced 3DSI (three dimensions of scientific impact) model, we have a clear distinction between the coefficients determining the total productivity (size), total impact (sum), and those that affect the shape of the resulting theoretical curve.  © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.",Bibliometric indices; Citation models; Informetrics; Interpretability; Science of science,Journal of Informetrics,Article,2023,1,NA,English,10.1016/j.joi.2022.101355

In this perspective, we argue that adversarial collaborative research has been stymied by an overly restrictive concern with the falsification of scientific theories. We advocate instead for a more expansive view that frames adversarial collaboration in terms of Bayesian belief updating, model comparison, and evidence accumulation. This framework broadens the scope of adversarial collaboration to accommodate a wide range of informative (but not necessarily definitive) studies while affording the requisite formal tools to guide experimental design and data analysis in the adversarial setting. We provide worked examples that demonstrate how these tools can be deployed to score theoretical models in terms of a common metric of evidence, thereby furnishing a means of tracking the amount of empirical support garnered by competing theories over time. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",adversarial collaboration; Bayesian inference; evidence accumulation; falsification; meta-science; model comparison,Neuron,Review,2023,9,NA,English,10.1016/j.neuron.2023.08.027

Five groups of five people with relevant domain expertise evaluated 25 research claims that were subject to at least one replication study. Participants assessed the probability that each of the 25 research claims would replicate (i.e. that a replication study would find a statistically significant result in the same direction as the original study) and described the reasoning behind those judgements. We quantitatively analysed possible correlates of predictive accuracy, including self-rated expertise and updating of judgements after feedback and discussion. We qualitatively analysed the reasoning data to explore the cues, heuristics and patterns of reasoning used by participants. Participants achieved 84% classification accuracy in predicting replicability. Those who engaged in a greater breadth of reasoning provided more accurate replicability judgements. Some reasons were more commonly invoked by more accurate participants, such as 'effect size' and 'reputation' (e.g. of the field of research). There was also some evidence of a relationship between statistical literacy and accuracy.  © 2023 The Authors.",expert judgement; forecasting; meta-research; metascience; mixed methods; replication,Royal Society Open Science,Article,2023,3,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1098/rsos.221553

However, the conceptual relationship among openness, replication experiments and results reproducibility has been obscure. We analyse the logical structure of experiments, define the mathematical notion of idealized experiment and use this notion to advance a theory of reproducibility. Idealized experiments clearly delineate the concepts of replication and results reproducibility, and capture key differences with precision, allowing us to study the relationship among them. We show how results reproducibility varies as a function of the elements of an idealized experiment, the true data-generating mechanism, and the closeness of the replication experiment to an original experiment. We clarify how openness of experiments is related to designing informative replication experiments and to obtaining reproducible results. With formal backing and evidence, we argue that the current 'crisis' reflects inadequate attention to a theoretical understanding of results reproducibility. © 2023 The Authors.",experiment; metascience; open science; replication; reproducibility; statistical theory,Royal Society Open Science,Article,2023,8,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1098/rsos.221042

In response, we convened a diverse community of researchers, research managers and funders to co-create actionable recommendations for supporting the equitable implementation of Open Research. Using a co-creative modified Delphi method, we generated consensus-driven recommendations that address three key problem areas: the resource-intensive nature of Open Research, the high cost of article processing charges, and obstructive reward and recognition practices at funders and research institutions that undermine the implementation of Open Research. In this paper, we provide an overview of these issues, a detailed description of the co-creative process, and present the recommendations and the debates that surrounded them.

Their purpose is to guide the types of data we collect, analyses we conduct, and inferences we would like to make. Over the last decade, metascience has advocated for hypotheses being in preregistrations or registered reports, but how to formulate these hypotheses has received less attention. Here, we argue that hypotheses can vary in specificity along at least three independent dimensions: the relationship, the variables, and the pipeline. Together, these dimensions form the scope of the hypothesis. We demonstrate how narrowing the scope of a hypothesis in any of these three ways reduces the hypothesis space and that this reduction is a type of novelty. Finally, we discuss how this formulation of hypotheses can guide researchers to formulate the appropriate scope for their hypotheses and should aim for neither too broad nor too narrow a scope. This framework can guide hypothesis-makers when formulating their hypotheses by helping clarify what is being tested, chaining results to previous known findings, and demarcating what is explicitly tested in the hypothesis.  © 2023 The Authors.",hypotheses; metascience; philosophy of science; psychology,Royal Society Open Science,Article,2023,3,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1098/rsos.230607

In this Perspective paper, we present a landscape of the area of applied materials in selected representative journals based on a combination of methods from network science and simple NLP strategies. We found a predominance of energy-related materials, e.g., for batteries and catalysis, organic electronics, which include flexible sensors and flexible electronics, and nanomedicine with various topics of materials used in diagnosis and therapy. As for the impact calculated through standard metrics of impact factor, energy-related materials and organic electronics are again top of the list across different journals, while work in nanomedicine has been found to have a lower impact in the journals analyzed. The adequacy of the approach to identify key research topics in materials applications was verified indirectly by comparing the topics identified in journals with diverse scopes, including journals that are not specific to materials.

This makes it challenging to define the boundaries and directions of the field. Here, nearly 100,000 articles on urban planning are analysed to objectively determine divisions, temporal trends and influential references and actors of urban planning. In terms of the structural composition, four broad divisions are identified: (1) governance and policy, (2) economics and markets, (3) housing and (4) built and natural environment. In terms of the temporal evolution, the earliest trends were related to “welfare economics”, “agglomeration economies”, “urban economics”, and “urban growth machine”. During the 1980s and 1990s, the focus moved towards “regional policy and development”, “social welfare”, and “urban renaissance”. This trend continued during the 2000s and 2010s, heading to “urban morphology”, “participatory planning”, “urban sociology”, “global cities”, and “political economy”.

These practices include publicly sharing deidentified data when possible, sharing analytical code, and preregistering study protocols. Empirical evidence from the social sciences suggests such practices are feasible, can improve analytical reproducibility, and can reduce selective reporting. In academic epidemiology, adoption of open-science practices has been slower than in the social sciences (with some notable exceptions, such as registering clinical trials). Epidemiologic studies are often large, complex, conceived after data have already been collected, and difficult to replicate directly by collecting new data. These characteristics make it especially important to ensure their integrity and analytical reproducibility. Open-science practices can also pay immediate dividends to researchers’ own work by clarifying scientific reasoning and encouraging well-documented, organized workf lows. We consider how established epidemiologists and early-career researchers alike can help midwife a culture of open science in epidemiology through their research practices, mentorship, and editorial activities. © The Author(s) 2023.

Prior studies in entrepreneurship-related disciplines carry the implicit notion that p-hacking is predominantly an issue in top-tier journals, where incentives to do so may be highest. This study investigates p-hacking in the family business literature, a research field with roots in the broader entrepreneurship and small business literatures, and in which discourse increasingly takes place in both dedicated field journals and in the top-tier outlets in entrepreneurship and management. Analyses of p-values published in these field- and top-tier journals allow for a comparison of the prevalence and correlates of p-hacking at these different levels of prestige. The findings suggest that p-hacking is an issue of substantial—and statistically indistinguishable—magnitudes in both field- and top-tier journals. We further observe negative correlations of female authorship and employer prestige with p-hacking, where the latter is stronger in field versus top-tier journals. Implications of these findings, their limitations, and some suggestions going forward are discussed, with particular attention for the promise of preregistration and registered reports. © The Author(s) 2021.",family business research; meta-science; p-hacking; questionable research practices,Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice,Article,2023,10,NA,English,10.1177/10422587211050354

As the results from the science of science often has strong policy implications, understanding the causal relationships between variables becomes prominent. However, the most credible quasi-experimental method among all causal inference methods, and a highly valuable tool in the empirical toolkit, Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) has not been fully exploited in the field of science of science. In this paper, we provide a systematic survey of the RDD method, and its practical applications in the science of science. Design/methodology/approach: First, we introduce the basic assumptions, mathematical notations, and two types of RDD, i.e., sharp and fuzzy RDD. Second, we use the Web of Science and the Microsoft Academic Graph datasets to study the evolution and citation patterns of RDD papers. Moreover, we provide a systematic survey of the applications of RDD methodologies in various scientific domains, as well as in the science of science. Finally, we demonstrate a case study to estimate the effect of Head Start Funding Proposals on child mortality. Findings: RDD was almost neglected for 30 years after it was first introduced in 1960. Afterward, scientists used mathematical and economic tools to develop the RDD methodology. After 2010, RDD methods showed strong applications in various domains, including medicine, psychology, political science and environmental science. However, we also notice that the RDD method has not been well developed in science of science research. Research Limitations: This work uses a keyword search to obtain RDD papers, which may neglect some related work. Additionally, our work does not aim to develop rigorous mathematical and technical details of RDD but rather focuses on its intuitions and applications. Practical implications: This work proposes how to use the RDD method in science of science research. Originality/value: This work systematically introduces the RDD, and calls for the awareness of using such a method in the field of science of science.  © 2023 Meiling Li et al., published by Sciendo.",Causal Inference; Regression Discontinuity Design; Science of Science,Journal of Data and Information Science,Article,2023,2,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.2478/jdis-2023-0008

We investigated the effects of these manipulations on 181 real journalists’ perceptions of each study’s trustworthiness and newsworthiness. Sample size was the only factor that had a robust influence on journalists’ ratings of how trustworthy and newsworthy a finding was; larger sample sizes led to an increase of about two-thirds of 1 point on a 7-point scale. University prestige had no effect in this controlled setting, and the effects of sample representativeness and of p values were inconclusive, but any effects in this setting are likely quite small. Exploratory analyses suggest that other types of prestige might be more important (i.e., journal prestige) and that study design (experimental vs. correlational) may also affect trustworthiness and newsworthiness. © The Author(s) 2023.",metascience; research practices; science communication; science reporting,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,Article,2023,0,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1177/25152459231183912

International mobility has been increasingly recognized as a strategy for scientists to expand their professional networks, and that could help narrow the gender gap in academic careers. Using bibliometric data on over 33 million Scopus publications, we provide a global and dynamic view of gendered patterns of transnational scholarly mobility, as measured by volume, distance, diversity, and distribution, from 1998 to 2017. We find that, while female researchers continued to be underrepresented among internationally mobile researchers and migrate over shorter distances, this gender gap was narrowing at a faster rate than the gender gap in the population of general active researchers. Globally, the origin and destination countries of both female and male mobile researchers became increasingly diversified, which suggests that scholarly migration has become less skewed and more globalized. However, the range of origin and destination countries continued to be narrower for women than for men. While the United States remained the leading academic destination worldwide, the shares of both female and male scholarly inflows to that country declined from around 25% to 20% over the study period, partially due to the growing relevance of China. This study offers a cross-national measurement of gender inequality in global scholarly migration that is essential for promoting gender-equitable science policies and for monitoring the impact of such interventions.

However, these analyses include contradictory arguments, such as which combinations of knowledge, over-specialization, or transdisciplinary factors have led to undervaluation. We claim that this is because the indicators of delayed recognition are methodologically similar but capture conceptually different phenomena. Subsequently, this paper examined the overlap of 11 slow-cited measures to identify the uniformity and inconsistency of delayed recognition. Consequently, each measure practically obtained different papers as delayed recognition objectively classified into four groups by citation feature clustering, albeit based on similar concepts. Despite the ambiguity, we found that all delayed recognition measures extract papers that are more likely to be single-author projects that make disruptive contributions to more diverse fields without extremely novel nor conventional knowledge combinations that have been gradually awakened, compared to the null models. This result is robust when applying other hyperparameters, research topic-controlled null models, year-controlled null models, and other fields. This strongly indicates that delayed recognition leads to the reconstruction of a new direction of science and contributes to pioneering a revolutionary research topic.

The study of the linguistic dimension of science leads to an analysis of science as rhetoric, that is, the multiple methods of persuasion employed by scientists for multiple audiences and consumers. In addition, the failure of justificationist epistemologies to capture what occurs in knowledge generation also leads to the view that science has a rhetorical dimension in which knowledge-generating processes remain rational but nonjustificationist. In this article, I argue that rhetoric provides a rich additional dimension for criticism in clinical psychological science to identify error. Engaging the rhetorical dimension of science can therefore make science more rational, not less. Some major tropes used in psychological journals are identified and criticized. © The Author(s) 2023.",philosophy of science; rhetoric; social processes,Clinical Psychological Science,Article,2023,1,NA,English,10.1177/21677026221147251

Yet, suggestions and recommendations tailored to child-robot-interaction (CRI) research, which poses its own additional set of challenges, remain limited. There is also an increased need within both HRI and CRI for inter and crossdisciplinary collaborations, where input from multiple different domains can contribute to better research outcomes. Consequently, this workshop aims to facilitate discussions between researchers from diverse disciplines within CRI. The workshop will open with a panel discussion between CRI researchers from different disciplines, followed by 3-minute flash talks of the accepted submissions. The second half of the workshop will consist of breakout group discussions, where both senior and junior academics from different disciplines can share their experiences of conducting CRI research. Through this workshop, we hope to create a common ground for addressing shared challenges in CRI, as well as identify a set of possible solutions going forward. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society.

There has also been an increase in the number of videos citing research articles, especially since it has become relatively commonplace for academic conferences to require video submissions. However, the relationship between research articles and YouTube videos is not clear, and the purpose of the present paper is to address this issue. We created new datasets using YouTube videos and mentions of research articles on various online platforms. We found that most of the articles cited in the videos are related to medicine and biochemistry. We analyzed these datasets through statistical techniques and visualization, and built machine learning models to predict (1) whether a research article is cited in videos, (2) whether a research article cited in a video achieves a level of popularity, and (3) whether a video citing a research article becomes popular. The best models achieved F1 scores between 80% and 94%. According to our results, research articles mentioned in more tweets and news coverage have a higher chance of receiving video citations. We also found that video views are important for predicting citations and increasing research articles’ popularity and public engagement with science. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Altmetrics; Machine learning; MetaScience; Research impact; Scholarly communication; Science of science; Scientometrics; Social media; Societal impact; YouTube,Scientometrics,Article,2023,17,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1007/s11192-022-04574-5

Method: Quantitative analyses using JASP were performed on the publication rate and number of authors in articles published in JSLHR for each year from 2001 to 2021. VOSviewer was used to analyze and visualize networks of co-occurring Keyword Plus terms extracted from the articles published in JSLHR for several representative years from 2001 to 2021. Results: Although the number of publications and number of authors published in JSLHR increased from 2001 to 2021, that growth was consistent with the growth found in science in general and with changes in publication policies and practices. The number and range of countries other than the United States pub-lished in JSLHR increased from 2001 to 2021. A consistent set of institutions published frequently in JSLHR across the years examined. The analysis of Key-word Plus terms showed an increase in the range of populations, disorders, and languages that were the subject of research from 2001 to 2021, as well as influences from other fields on speech, language, and hearing sciences. Conclusion: The science of science approach and the tools of network science are useful for assessing how changes in editorial policy affect diversity, for monitoring research topics that are growing (or declining), for identifying institu-tions that lead the field, and for inviting discussions among various interested parties related to the growth and development of a discipline. © 2023 The Author.",NA,"Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research",Review,2023,2,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1044/2023_JSLHR-23-00203

To this end, we curated a representative dataset covering 1466 prizewinning scientists from 35 prestigious scientific prizes in seven disciplines. To investigate the potential benefits of one's academic career following the receipt of a prize, we matched each prizewinner with contenders to make sure that the winner and the contenders have comparable academic performance before prizewinning. Then the future performance of prizewinners and contenders in the same group are compared on three dimensions – productivity, scientific impact, and career persistence. Our findings suggest that after winning a prestigious prize, scientists generally publish more papers and receive more citations compared to their contenders. As for persistence, the Kaplan-Meier estimates on career length after the prizewinning show that scientists tend to maintain a longer active research career if their scientific merit are recognized via prizewinning. In addition, when dividing the prizewinners into three subgroups which are young, middle-aged, and senior prizewinners, we found that scientists tend to maintain a longer active career if they win prizes at the young or middle-aged career stage, while the difference is not significant between senior prizewinners and their contenders. Finally, we constructed a Cox proportional hazards model and found that the hazards of ending the academic career for young and middle-aged prizewinners are 59.5% and 31.1% lower than their contenders, respectively. This work highlights the importance of scientific merit recognition for scientists at their earlier career stage and provides strong implications for scientists’ career development. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Career development; Computational social science; Science of science; Scientific awards; Scientific performance,Journal of Informetrics,Article,2023,6,NA,English,10.1016/j.joi.2023.101408

The limitations that authors acknowledge in their articles offer a glimpse into some of the concerns that occupy a field’s attention. We examine the types of limitations authors discuss in their published articles by categorizing them according to the four validities framework and investigate whether the field’s attention to each of the four validities has shifted from 2010 to 2020. We selected one journal in social and personality psychology (Social Psychological and Personality Science; SPPS), the subfield most in the crosshairs of psychology’s replication crisis. We sampled 440 articles (with half of those articles containing a subsection explicitly addressing limitations), and we identified and categorized 831 limitations across the 440 articles. Articles with limitations sections reported more limitations than those without (avg. 2.6 vs. 1.2 limitations per article). Threats to external validity were the most common type of reported limitation (est. 52% of articles), and threats to statistical conclusion validity were the least common (est. 17% of articles). Authors reported slightly more limitations over time. Despite the extensive attention paid to statistical conclusion validity in the scientific discourse throughout psychology’s credibility revolution, our results suggest that concerns about statistics-related issues were not reflected in social and personality psychologists’ reported limitations. The high prevalence of limitations concerning external validity might suggest it is time that we improve our practices in this area, rather than apologizing for these limitations after the fact. © 2023 American Psychological Association",limitations; metascience; research methods; social and personality psychology; the four validities,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,Article,2023,5,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1037/pspp0000458

Although often discussed separately, these five challenges may share a common cause: insufficient investment of intellectual and nonintellectual resources into the typical psychology study. We suggest that the emerging emphasis on big-team science can help address these challenges by allowing researchers to pool their resources together to increase the amount available for a single study. However, the current incentives, infrastructure, and institutions in academic science have all developed under the assumption that science is conducted by solo principal investigators and their dependent trainees, an assumption that creates barriers to sustainable big-team science. We also anticipate that big-team science carries unique risks, such as the potential for big-team-science organizations to be co-opted by unaccountable leaders, become overly conservative, and make mistakes at a grand scale. Big-team-science organizations must also acquire personnel who are properly compensated and have clear roles. Not doing so raises risks related to mismanagement and a lack of financial sustainability. If researchers can manage its unique barriers and risks, big-team science has the potential to spur great progress in psychology and beyond. © The Author(s) 2022.",allied field: philosophy; allied field: sociology; big-team science; metascience; methodology: scientific,Perspectives on Psychological Science,Article,2023,43,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1177/17456916221082970

Yet small-scale manual replication methods alone are ill-suited to deal with this big data problem. Here, we conduct a discipline-wide replication census in science. Our sample (N = 14,126 papers) covers nearly all papers published in the six top-tier Psychology journals over the past 20 y. Using a validated machine learning model that estimates a paper’s likelihood of replication, we found evidence that both supports and refutes speculations drawn from a relatively small sample of manual replications. First, we find that a single overall replication rate of Psychology poorly captures the varying degree of replicability among subfields. Second, we find that replication rates are strongly correlated with research methods in all subfields. Experiments replicate at a significantly lower rate than do non-experimental studies. Third, we find that authors’ cumulative publication number and citation impact are positively related to the likelihood of replication, while other proxies of research quality and rigor, such as an author’s university prestige and a paper’s citations, are unrelated to replicability. Finally, contrary to the ideal that media attention should cover replicable research, we find that media attention is positively related to the likelihood of replication failure. Our assessments of the scale and scope of replicability are important next steps toward broadly resolving issues of replicability. Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

Computer Security has the natural benefit of creating artifacts that should facilitate computational reproducibility, the ability for others to use someone else's code and data to independently recreate results, in a relatively straightforward fashion. While the Security community has recently increased its attention on reproducibility, an independent and comprehensive measurement of the current state of reproducibility has not been conducted. In this paper, we perform the first such study, targeting reproducible artifacts generated specifically by papers on machine learning security (one of the most popular areas in academic research) published in Tier 1 security conferences over the past ten years (2013-2022). We perform our measurement study of indirect and direct reproducibility over nearly 750 papers, their codebases, and datasets. Our analysis shows that there is no statistically significant difference between the availability of artifacts before and after the introduction of Artifact Evaluation Committees in Tier 1 conferences. However, based on three years of results, artifacts that pass through this process work at a higher rate than those that do not. From our collected findings, we offer data-driven suggestions for improving reproducibility in our community, including five common problems observed in our study. In so doing, we demonstrate that significant progress still needs to be made in computational reproducibility in Computer Security research. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",machine learning; meta-science; reproducibility; security,CCS 2023 - Proceedings of the 2023 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,Conference paper,2023,5,NA,English,10.1145/3576915.3623130

Recent metascience has suggested that kinesiology research may be underpowered and selectively reported. Here, we examined whether power analyses are being used to ensure informative studies in motor behavior. We reviewed every article published in three motor behavior journals between January 2019 and June 2021. Power analyses were reported in 13% of studies (k = 636) that tested a hypothesis. No study targeted the smallest effect size of interest. Most studies with a power analysis relied on estimates from previous experiments, pilot studies, or benchmarks to determine the effect size of interest. Studies without a power analysis reported support for their main hypothesis 85% of the time, while studies with a power analysis found support 76% of the time. The median sample sizes were n = 17.5 without a power analysis and n = 16 with a power analysis, suggesting the typical study design was underpowered for all but the largest plausible effect size. At present, power analyses are not being used to optimize the informativeness of motor behavior research.

DID method outputs the unbiased estimation on condition that several hypotheses hold, especially the common trend assumption. In this paper, we gave a systematic demonstration of DID in the science of science, and the potential ways to improve the accuracy of DID method. Design/methodology/approach: At first, we reviewed the statistical assumptions, the model specification, and the application procedures of DID method. Second, to improve the necessary assumptions before conducting DID regression and the accuracy of estimation, we introduced some matching techniques serving as the pre-selecting step for DID design by matching control individuals who are equivalent to those treated ones on observational variables before the intervention. Lastly, we performed a case study to estimate the effects of prizewinning on the scientific performance of Nobel laureates, by comparing the yearly citation impact after the prizewinning year between Nobel laureates and their prizewinning-work coauthors. Findings: We introduced the procedures to conduct a DID estimation and demonstrated the effectiveness to use matching method to improve the results. As a case study, we found that there are no significant increases in citations for Nobel laureates compared to their prizewinning coauthors.

In this paper, we present an extension of existing disruptive metrics and introduce new ones, namely the disruptive coefficient (D) and 2-step disruptive coefficient (2-step D), as innovative tools for identifying critical nodes in complex networks. Our approach emphasizes the importance of disruptiveness in characterizing nodes within the network and detecting their criticality. Our new measures take into account both prior and posterior information of the focal nodes, by evaluating their ability to disrupt the previous network paradigm, setting them apart from traditional measures. We conduct an empirical analysis of four real-world networks to compare the rankings or identification of nodes using D and 2stepD with those obtained from four renowned benchmark measures, namely, degree, h-index, PageRank, and the CD index. Our analysis reveals significant differences between the nodes identified by D and 2stepD and those identified by the benchmark measures. We also examine the correlation coefficient and efficiency of the metrics and find that D and 2stepD have significant correlations with the CD index, but have weak correlations with the benchmark measures. Furthermore, we show that D and 2stepD outperform CD index and random ways in intentional attacks. We find power law distributions for D, 2stepD, and CD, indicating a small number of highly disruptive nodes and a large number of less disruptive nodes in the networks. Our results suggest that D and 2stepD are capable of providing valuable and distinct insights for identifying critical nodes in complex networks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Complex networks; Disruption; Power law; Science of science; Vital nodes,Journal of Informetrics,Article,2023,14,NA,English,10.1016/j.joi.2023.101411

This work investigates the reasons for these differences by visiting 1.7M webpages with five different measurement setups. Based on this investigation, we build 'dependency trees' for each page and cross-compare the nodes in the trees. The results show that the measured trees differ considerably, that the cause of differences can be attributed to specific nodes, and that even identical measurement setups can produce different results. © 2023 ACM.",metascience; reproducibility; robustness; web measurements,"Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference, IMC",Conference paper,2023,1,NA,English,10.1145/3618257.3624795

At the same time, sustainability research, mostly under the umbrella of sustainability science, is abundant with dubious methods and dubious aims of research, contributing to the already widespread crisis of the quality control mechanisms in science. This paper identifies some of these dubious methods (non-systemic thinking and specific contractual funding mechanisms) and dubious aims (unclear aims and undisclosed value assumptions), and argues that, with proper expert evaluation, it is possible to predict the type of content (and the scientific value) these forms of research will result in. Identifying the forms of research with predictably dubious results has practical implications for doing and evaluating research in sustainability science, on the one hand, while on the other, it contributes to the discussion on the ideal of well-ordered science by concretizing the ideal and developing a criterion for ordering science in the case of sustainability science. Finally, the paper provides a connection of sustainability science with the meta-science discussions on the crisis in the quality of science and on science organization, what at the same time more closely connects the philosophy of science with problems encountered in research practice tackling urgent, complex and value-laden problems. © 2023 The Author(s)",Crisis in science; Pursuitworthiness; Sustainability science; Systems thinking; Urgent research; Values in science; Well-ordered science,Studies in History and Philosophy of Science,Article,2023,0,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1016/j.shpsa.2023.01.004

In the current work, we test whether delegating parts of the research process to LLMs leads people to distrust researchers and devalues their scientific work. Participants (N = 402) considered a researcher who delegates elements of the research process to a PhD student or LLM and rated three aspects of such delegation. Firstly, they rated whether it is morally appropriate to do so. Secondly, they judged whether - after deciding to delegate the research process - they would trust the scientist (that decided to delegate) to oversee future projects. Thirdly, they rated the expected accuracy and quality of the output from the delegated research process. Our results show that people judged delegating to an LLM as less morally acceptable than delegating to a human (d = -0.78). Delegation to an LLM also decreased trust to oversee future research projects (d = -0.80), and people thought the results would be less accurate and of lower quality (d = -0.85).

Researchers can perform a priori power analyses to ensure adequately powered studies. However, there are common pitfalls that can result in underestimating the required sample size for a given design and effect size of interest. Critical evaluation of power analyses requires successful analysis reproduction, which is conditional on the reporting of sufficient information. Here, we attempted to reproduce every power analysis reported in articles (k = 84/635) in three motor behavior journals between January 2019 and June 2021. We reproduced 7% of analyses using the reported information, which increased to 43% when we assumed plausible values for missing parameters. Among studies that reported sufficient information to evaluate, 63% reported using the same statistical test in the power analysis as in the study itself, and in 77%, the test addressed at least one of the identified hypotheses. Overall, power analyses were not commonly reported with sufficient information to ensure reproducibility. A nontrivial number of power analyses were also affected by common pitfalls. There is substantial opportunity to address the issue of underpowered research in motor behavior by increasing adoption of power analyses and ensuring reproducible reporting practices. © 2023 Human Kinetics Publishers Inc..

This article seeks to explain why the reproducibility crisis has taken root and become a force in science policy in ways previous crises have not. In short, we argue that it was through the scientific, institutional, and cultural efforts of a group of scientific activists we are calling metascientists. Metascience is a scientific social movement that seeks to use quantification and experimentation to diagnose problems in research practice and improve efficiency. It draws together data scientists, experimental and statistical methodologists, and open science activists into a project with both intellectual and policy dimensions. Metascientists have been remarkably successful at winning grants, motivating news coverage, and changing policies at science agencies, journals, and universities. The social movement lens is useful for understanding the popularization and impact of the reproducibility crisis narrative and suggests ways the institutions of science are adapting to meet a changing political and technological landscape. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Metascience; Replication crisis; Reproducibility crisis; Scientific social movements,Minerva,Article,2023,9,NA,English,10.1007/s11024-023-09490-3

Traditional metrics like total citation and h-index are limited in their ability to capture the full range of a scientist's influence, and therefore the Scientists' Disruptive Citation (SDC), Disruptive h-index (D h-index), and consolidating metrics are introduced to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of scientists' disruptive and consolidating influence. Using a dataset of 463,348 papers, 234,086 disambiguated scientists, and data on three important awards, including Nobel Prize, Wolf Prize, and Dirac Medal, in the field of Physics, this study demonstrates that the SDC and D h-index are superior to all benchmark metrics, including the conventional and normalized disruption-based measures, in terms of convergent validity. Second, this study analyzes the distribution of academic characteristics between award-winning and non-laureates, explores various metrics of scientists with high SDC and Scientists' Consolidating Citation (SCC), and finds that disruptive impact can identify successful scientists from their counterparts and serve as an early signal of successful scientists. Third, this study reveals that the disruptive citation proposed in this study is less susceptible to manipulation, making it a more reliable metric for assessing a scientist's or a single paper's disruptive impact than the CD-index. The results suggest that the SDC and D h-index are reliable metrics for measuring scientists' innovative influence and can aid in the development of future scientific research.

In this study, we introduce the concept of the k-step h-index and investigate its applicability in citation networks at different levels, including papers, authors, and institutions. By incorporating higher generations of citation information, the k-step h-index provides a comprehensive and nuanced measure of scientific influence. It demonstrates exponential growth in k-step citations, capturing valuable information from the Hirsch core and tail. Through power law distribution analysis, we uncover the presence of highly influential entities coexisting with less influential ones, revealing the heterogeneity of impact within citation networks. To validate the effectiveness of the k-step h-index, we utilize a vast dataset from APS, conducting a thorough examination of its consistency and convergent validity. Our findings demonstrate strong correlations between the k-step h-index and conventional metrics, as well as alignment with measures of innovation. This confirms the reliability of the k-step h-index and its ability to capture innovative contributions. Notably, when compared to benchmarks, the k-step h-index outperforms in accurately ranking expert-selected items, including milestone papers, distinguished authors, and prestigious institutions. Higher values of the k-step h-index consistently exhibit superior performance, showcasing their predictive power in identifying prominent scientific entities.

Despite the advent of initiatives to increase transparency in research reporting, the field is still lacking tools to verify the credibility of research reports. In the present paper, we describe methodologies that let researchers craft highly credible research and allow their peers to verify this credibility. We demonstrate the application of these methods in a multi-laboratory replication of Bem's Experiment 1 (Bem 2011 J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 100, 407-425. (doi:10.1037/a0021524)) on extrasensory perception (ESP), which was co-designed by a consensus panel including both proponents and opponents of Bem's original hypothesis. In the study we applied direct data deposition in combination with born-open data and real-time research reports to extend transparency to protocol delivery and data collection. We also used piloting, checklists, laboratory logs and video-documented trial sessions to ascertain as-intended protocol delivery, and external research auditors to monitor research integrity. We found 49.89% successful guesses, while Bem reported 53.07% success rate, with the chance level being 50%. Thus, Bem's findings were not replicated in our study.

One such aspect is editorial board composition, which has been shown to exhibit racial and geographical disparities. However, the literature on this subject lacks longitudinal studies quantifying the degree to which the racial composition of editors reflects that of scientists. Other aspects that may exhibit racial disparities include the time spent between the submission and acceptance of a manuscript and the number of citations a paper receives relative to textually similar papers, but these have not been studied to date. To fill this gap, we compile a dataset of 1,000,000 papers published between 2001 and 2020 by six publishers, while identifying the handling editor of each paper. Using this dataset, we show that most countries in Asia, Africa, and South America (where the majority of the population is ethnically non-White) have fewer editors than would be expected based on their share of authorship. Focusing on US-based scientists reveals Black as the most underrepresented race. In terms of acceptance delay, we find, again, that papers from Asia, Africa, and South America spend more time compared to other papers published in the same journal and the same year. Regression analysis of US-based papers reveals that Black authors suffer from the greatest delay. Finally, by analyzing citation rates of US-based papers, we find that Black and Hispanic scientists receive significantly fewer citations compared to White ones doing similar research.

The quality and amount of scientific capabilities in specific fields vary dramatically across different world regions. Capabilities, knowledge, and skills are embodied by scientists working in research institutions or companies. The conditions for the emergence of a leading regional scientific environment – and the resulting early technological leadership – are poorly understood. The existence of a critical mass – the threshold above which a region can build comparably strong scientific capabilities – of scientists is often assumed. Using a unique dataset of global scientific activity and researcher mobility over several decades, we present empirical evidence in three scientific areas (semiconductor research, embryonic stem cells, and Internet research) that the process of scientific knowledge accumulation is remarkably general and applies to practically all regions. Regional knowledge accumulation data obtained from an analysis of scientists’ geolocated trajectories follow a preferential attachment mechanism characterized by a sub-linear kernel with a robust growth exponent. Scale-free growth patterns suggest that regions that move early into new technologies tend to dominate the corresponding scientific fields. We find no evidence that critical mass is required to achieve prolonged scientific dominance. We propose a simple preferential attachment model that explains the empirical data and allows us to understand deviations from the growth exponent as focused interventions to strategically attract scientists at regional level. We demonstrate this explicitly for China in the three scientific fields examined. © 2022",Critical mass; Preferential attachment; Scaling; Science of science,"Chaos, Solitons and Fractals",Article,2023,0,NA,English,10.1016/j.chaos.2022.113020

Gender difference in the scientific community is an important issue of concern to scholars of the science of science at home and abroad. As an important performance measure of scholars, gender difference of academic influence is also widely studied by scholars, also known as the gender citation gap. At the same time, scholars are constantly excavating the influencing factors of gender differences in academic influence from the personal and social levels, including marriage and fertility factors, institutional factors, social relations, potential occupational discrimination, etc., trying to identify the direct causes. However, while gender difference is a sociological phenomenon whose influencing factors are complex and interlinked. With the increasing improvement of gender policies in the field of science and technology and social life, some direct influencing factors have been weakened, and knowledge characteristics such as research expertise have gradually been mentioned. In recent years, with the rapid development of scientific and technological innovation, interdisciplinarity has gradually became the focus. The huge innovation potential of interdisciplinary research has been confirmed, and its relationship with influence has been frequently mentioned and explored. The paper focus on the perspective of knowledge distribution, explore whether there are gender differences in scholars' interdisciplinarity, and whether this difference is an important factor affecting gender differences in academic influence. The paper uses the ORCID database of 43,095 scholars and the corresponding 1,154,987 Web of Science papers as research samples, uses the Genderize. io database to identify and mark the gender of scholars, and uses A. Stirlingś three-dimensional interdisciplinary dimension framework(discipline diversity, discipline balance, discipline disparity) to measure the interdisciplinarity of scholars, and the academic age, subject field, prestige of the work institution and the prestige of the doctoral institution are used as control variables, and uses the method including statistical analysis, mediation effect analysis and moderation effect analysis. Three questions were answered: (1) Are there significant gender differences in the interdisciplinarity and academic influence of scholars? (2) Are gender differences among scholars in interdisciplinarity an important factor contributing to the gender citation gap? (3) Will gender differences in scholars’ interdisciplinarity further affect gender differences in academic influence? The research results show that, compared with women, menś research paper have higher disciplinary diversity, disciplinary disparity and lower disciplinary balance, which reflects that men can ensure that their knowledge is widely distributed on the premise, and also promise the research professionalism, which constitutes the gender difference in academic influence. And under the same circumstances, compared with female colleagues, men can receive a higher return on academic influence when enhance the interdisciplinarity of research. Therefore, under the tide of vigorously promoting interdisciplinary research, the results of the study suggests that it is necessary to encourage women to conduct academic exchanges with scholars in other disciplines/research fields to improve their discipline diversity, and it’ s also important to build communication platforms and opportunities for them to improve the professionalism of their research in the advantageous fields, and promote the development of their knowledge in a "" T"" shape. © 2023 Editorial Department of Studies in Science of Science.

Significant problems are found in each dimension, and suggestions for improvements are offered. ACT aligns with a Machiavellianism that is problematic in accurately describing these commitments and constituting a meta-stance that permits problematic values to be embraced. Relatedly, there is evidence of a positive bias in ACT research that has been ignored methodologically and in summaries of ACT. These problems justify significant skepticism regarding any claims from the science associated with ACT.

Verharen J.P.H.,57194271114,"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, United States",ChatGPT identifies gender disparities in scientific peer review,"The peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAI's generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports, which demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional lexicon- and rule-based language models. As expected, most reviews for these published papers were seen as favorable by ChatGPT (89.8% of reviews), and language use was mostly polite (99.8% of reviews). However, this analysis also demonstrated high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results further revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. In addition, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, for which I discuss potential causes. Together, this study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in performing natural language processing of specialized scientific texts. As a proof of concept, I show that ChatGPT can identify areas of concern in scientific peer review, underscoring the importance of transparent peer review in studying equitability in scientific publishing. © 2023, Verharen.; Peer review is a vital step in ensuring the quality and accuracy of scientific research before publication. Experts assess research manuscripts, advise journal editors on publishing them, and provide authors with recommendations for improvement. But some scientists have raised concerns about potential biases and subjectivity in the peer review process. Author attributes, such as gender, reputation, or how prestigious their institution is, may subconsciously influence reviewers’ scores. Studying peer review to identify potential biases is challenging. The language reviewers use is very technical, and some of their commentary may be subjective and vary from reviewer to reviewer. The emergence of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which uses machine learning to process large amounts of information, may provide a new tool to analyze peer review for signs of bias. Verharen demonstrated that ChatGPT can be used to analyze peer review reports and found potential indications of gender bias in scientific publishing. In the experiments, Verharen asked ChatGPT to analyze more than 500 reviews of 200 neuroscience studies published in the scientific journal Nature Communications over the past year. The experiments found no evidence that institutional reputation influenced reviews. Yet, female first authors were more likely to receive impolite comments from reviewers. Female senior authors were more likely to receive higher review scores, which may indicate they had to clear a higher bar for publication. The experiments indicate that ChatGPT could be used to analyze peer review for fairness. Verharen suggests that reviewers might apply this tool to ensure their reviews are polite and accurate reflections of their opinions. Scientists or publishers might also use it for large-scale analyses of peer review in individual journals or in scientific publishing more widely. Journals might also use ChatGPT to assess the impact of bias-prevention interventions on review fairness.",artificial intelligence; meta-science; natural language processing; neuroscience; none; peer review,eLife,Article,2023,8,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.7554/eLife.90230

Part of this interest is related to ethics in research and institutional ethics related to research ethics committees. This phenomenon has also increased ethical or moral demands by institutions and academic-scientific collectives. Problem: Research in Ehics presents several issues, challenges, and difficulties, which go beyond a basic or superficial knowledge. These deficiencies or limitations have negative ethical consequences, including in a political sense, for the Brazilian computing community. Solution: We bring a collection of objective and informative reflections on these topics, which are rarely addressed or found in the computing literature, adequately suited to the IS context. Theory: Qualitative approach through Hermeneutics, Critical social theory, and Theory of reasoned action. Research method: Prescriptive and transformative, based on ethnography and autoethnography methodologies. Results and contributions to IS: We present several abstract and concrete considerations about advanced or non-trivial research ethics and ethics committee topics.

This fundamental question has been debated among leading scholars for centuries, and more recently, it has been tested in experimental studies yielding a body of rather inconclusive empirical evidence. A potential source of ambivalent empirical results on the same hypothesis is design heterogeneity—variation in true effect sizes across various reasonable experimental research protocols. To provide further evidence on whether competition affects moral behavior and to examine whether the generalizability of a single experimental study is jeopardized by design heterogeneity, we invited independent research teams to contribute experimental designs to a crowd-sourced project. In a large-scale online data collection, 18,123 experimental participants were randomly allocated to 45 randomly selected experimental designs out of 95 submitted designs. We find a small adverse effect of competition on moral behavior in a meta-analysis of the pooled data. The crowd-sourced design of our study allows for a clean identification and estimation of the variation in effect sizes above and beyond what could be expected due to sampling variance. We find substantial design heterogeneity—estimated to be about 1.6 times as large as the average standard error of effect size estimates of the 45 research designs—indicating that the informativeness and generalizability of results based on a single experimental design are limited. Drawing strong conclusions about the underlying hypotheses in the presence of substantive design heterogeneity requires moving toward much larger data collections on various experimental designs testing the same hypothesis.

When the disruption event COVID-19 occurred, however, people’s demand for breakthrough research, such as vaccinations or treatments, became increasingly pressing. Under such circumstances, can the accumulated coronavirus-related knowledge still give solid support for COVID-19 research? The manner of utilizing and absorbing new knowledge in the citing publications is reflected in the reference analysis. To investigate this proposition, we employ reference analysis to conduct retrospectives on relevant scientific articles. We locate 309,517 related papers and their references in the CORD-19 data from 2000 to 2021. We analyze the knowledge support capacity of previous studies from three aspects: the quantity, timeliness, and textual support of references. Among them, textual support is divided into lexical, topic, and semantic support, which are respectively based on TF-IDF, LDA, and fine-tuned sentence-BERT. Our findings demonstrate that COVID-19 has caused unprecedented destruction of the original knowledge support pattern in the early stages of research (which is at odds with the knowledge support pattern in the general scientific background). The long-term accumulated and non-direct knowledge provides brief support for the COVID-19 investigation. Follow-up research will swiftly replace outdated information with new study findings. The appeal of the scientific community has moved from “return to the past” to “innovative alternatives”. We divide the process into three stages: rearrangement, iteration, and growth. The loss in knowledge support capacity following a disruptive event such as COVID-19 enhances the difficulty of research. However, it cannot be ignored that it has also considerably sped the pace of knowledge production. © 2023, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",COVID-19; Reference analysis; Reference support; Science of science; Sentence-BERT,Scientometrics,Article,2023,3,NA,English,10.1007/s11192-023-04764-9

While the tram was still departing the station, Brazil boarded it. However, Tim Berners-Lee offers harsh criticism of the Web’s effects, applications, and uses three decades after he lay the Web’s conceptual cornerstone. Such as false information, widespread manipulation, the unethical use and exploitation of personal information, corporate monopolies, and dangers to democracy. He followed and kept abreast of the moral implications of the Web. However, did WebMedia also stay up in this context? We followed the Systematic Literature Review methodology with the aim to answer how WebMedia research published between 2005 and 2022 explicitly incorporates ethics. We analyzed 1331 papers, 52 (≈4%) presented ethical aspects, and, from these, one stood out. We concluded that the ethical aspects remained tiny, considering the time coverage. Less than 10% of the publications presented some ethical aspects, including the respective research. The occurrences of Ethics Committee, Informed Consent, or a combination of both did not reach 2% of the publications. Even though the Web and Multimedia are cross-cutting themes in technical and non-technical aspects, the first is dominant. In contrast, the deliberations related to the second are limited, as well as on Ethics or Morals. Therefore, we propose guidelines for community appreciation, embracing a culture of ethical aspects.

In this paper, we focus on the association between collaboration networks and scientists producing novel and disruptive research, based on the publication data from the American Physical Society. In particular, we focus on the role of spanning structural holes on producing novel and disruptive research. Our primary finding is that scientists whose collaboration networks span over structural holes in their collaboration networks not only produce more novel and disruptive research, but also have higher chance to produce novel and disruptive research. Although both male and female scientists benefit from structural holes, we find suggestive evidence that female researchers benefit more. This paper provides empirical evidence on the relationship between structural holes and novel/disruptive research in the field of physics, which has policy implications for nurturing scientists and developing science policies. © 2023, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Collaboration Networks; Disruption; Novelty; Science of Science; Structural Holes,Scientometrics,Article,2023,13,NA,English,10.1007/s11192-023-04635-3

Here we demonstrate how such argumentation problematizes the relationship between models and their targets; we place emphasis on artificial neural networks (ANNs), though any theory-brain relationship that falls into the same schema of reasoning is at risk. In this paper, we model inferences from ANNs to brains and back within a formal framework — metatheoretical calculus — in order to initiate a dialogue on both how models are broadly understood and used, and on how to best formally characterize them and their functions. To these ends, we express claims from the published record about models’ successes and failures in first-order logic. Our proposed formalization describes the decision-making processes enacted by scientists to adjudicate over theories. We demonstrate that formalizing the argumentation in the literature can uncover potential deep issues about how theory is related to phenomena. We discuss what this means broadly for research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology; what it means for models when they lose the ability to mediate between theory and data in a meaningful way; and what this means for the metatheoretical calculus our fields deploy when performing high-level scientific inference. © 2023, The Author(s).",Cognitive computational neuroscience; Cognitive science; Logic; Metascience; Metatheory; Philosophy of science; Scientific inference,Computational Brain and Behavior,Article,2023,36,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1007/s42113-022-00166-x

In the Indian context, the theme has been rigorously researched, uncovering various theoretical and practical aspects. However, the strategists find themselves overwhelmed with the recommendations of researchers, which limit their efficiency in formulating plans. The study aimed to map the evolution of research on sustainable tourism in India and suggested future research actions and practical implications for managers. Methodology: The study applied SPAR-4-SLR, a scientific research protocol, to identify the 56 articles published in the Web of Science (WoS)-indexed journals. The study then used Science of Science (Sci2) and Gephi to conduct descriptive and network analyses, such as bibliographic coupling, keyword co-occurrences, and co-authorship analysis. Findings: The findings revealed that ST research in India revolved around managing the impact of tourism on the environment, developing economic avenues for sustainable tourism, balancing environment conservation and development, and understanding communities’ perceptions and eco-tourism. The results further highlighted a lack of empirical research linking SDG attainment to tourism sustainability. Practical Implications: The study will help researchers focus more on identifying the interlinkages between the SDGs that could be attained through sustainable tourism. Industry practitioners could benefit by identifying the knowledge gap in the theory and practice of effective strategy development. Originality: The study is one of a kind in using bibliometrics to study the themes in ST research in India and suggests future research areas post-pandemic that would assist researchers and policymakers. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Though this mission is admirable, value statements do little, on their own, to create an inclusive, high-quality science that benefits humanity broadly. In this research, we evaluate relationship science, a major subfield of social–personality psychology, illustrating both the unique diversity-relevant challenges faced by particular subfields and the barriers to inclusive and diverse research that are shared across research areas. Specifically, we examine the sample diversity and reporting practices of 1,762 studies published in eight mainstream psychology and relationships journals at two time points—(a) 1996–2000 and (b) 2016–2020—and center our analysis around five focal sample characteristics: gender, sexual orientation, regional context, socioeconomic status (SES), and race. We find that reporting practices and representation have not improved for some core demographic characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status) and that even in domains for which reporting practices have improved (e.g., sexual orientation), reporting remains limited. Further, we find that reporting practices in relationship science frequently center Whiteness (e.g., “participants were mostly White”), obscure or overlook potential sexual orientation diversity (e.g., implying that individuals in man–woman dyads are “heterosexual”), and treat the United States as the contextual default (e.g., participants came from a “large Southeastern university”).

However, emerging concerns regarding the replicability of scientific findings across psychology and mental health treatment outcome research highlight a need to re-examine the strength of evidence for treatment efficacy. Therefore, we conducted a metascientific review of the evidential value of ACT in treating depression. Whereas reporting accuracy was generally high across all trials, we found important differences in evidential value metrics corresponding to the types of control conditions used. RCTs of ACT compared to weaker controls (e.g., no treatment, waitlist) were well-powered, with sample sizes appropriate for detecting plausible effect sizes. They typically yielded stronger Bayesian evidence for (and larger posterior estimates of) ACT efficacy, though there was some evidence of significance inflation among these effects. RCTs of ACT against stronger controls (e.g., other psychotherapies), meanwhile, were poorly powered, designed to detect implausibly large effect sizes, and yielded ambiguous—if not contradicting—Bayesian evidence and estimates of efficacy. Although our review supports a view of ACT as efficacious for treating depression compared to weaker controls, future RCTs must provide more transparent reporting with larger groups of participants to properly assess the difference between ACT and competitor treatments such as behavioral activation and other forms of cognitive behavioral therapy. Clinicians and health organizations should reassess the use of ACT for depression if costs and resources are higher than for other efficacious treatments.

The method of multiple analysts is a way to study the analytical flexibility and behaviour of researchers under naturalistic conditions, as part of the field known as metascience. Analytical flexibility and risks of bias can be counteracted by open data sharing, pre-registration of analysis plans, and registration of clinical trials in trial registers. These measures are particularly important for retrospective studies where analytical flexibility can be greatest, although pre-registration is less useful in this context. Synthetic datasets can be an alternative to pre-registration when used to decide what analyses should be conducted on real datasets by independent parties.

These data of past documentation projects are currently playing a minor role in the design of modern language archives. This is due to various challenges that legacy materials pose – ethical considerations, difficulties with formats, unclear or deficient metadata. Tackling these challenges can highlight general issues in language documentation and the use of language data. These insights can be used to inform the design of tools and infrastructures for data in this field, both recent and legacy materials. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is conceptual and theorises digital language archives through their oldest deposits. It is informed by the author’s experiences in working with linguistic legacy materials of the South Estonian Kraasna dialect. The discussion makes references to relevant discourses in linguistics, archiving and computer science, encouraging transdisciplinary efforts in the design of language archives. Findings: A digital archive created around linguistic legacy materials has the potential to respond to challenges posed by current data. Originality/value: This paper discusses digital language archives from the perspective of documentary linguistics. It introduces the challenges and necessary steps in curating legacy materials.

Two main avenues to the understanding of philosophy’s vocations in India have been paved in the Mānavadharmaśāstra, along with commentaries thereon and by Kamandaki (as the knowledge of Ātman) and in the Arthaśāstra and the texts of the Nyāya school (as a metascience helping the other branches of knowledge bear their fruits). Therefore philosophy in India as well was regarded as the duality of ideological and methodological constituents, and it was Vātsyāyana who in all clarity pointed out that his science of Nyāya was not “the mere knowledge of Ātman” in the manner of the Upanişads but the same knowledge as realized in the context of professional investigation of 16 categorial topics. It is the significance of ānvīkşikī as examination of concepts with the philosophers of Nyāya and as polemical debate with Rājaśekhara that leads one to conclude that in classical India philosophy has been regarded not as a body of doctrines but as analytical practice (with the exact similarities to Wittgensteins’s understanding of it) as realized in controversy and that unfolds very meaningful horizons for comparative philosophy. © 2023 Vladimir K.

In this study, we use Scopus bibliometric data on eight million publications from 1.1 million researchers who have published at least once with an affiliation address from Germany in 1996–2020. We construct the partial life histories of published researchers in this period and explore both their out-migration and the subsequent return of a subset of this group: the returnees. Our analyses shed light on the career stages and gender disparities between researchers who remain in Germany, those who emigrate, and those who eventually return. We find that the return migration streams are even more gender imbalanced, which points to the need for additional efforts to encourage female researchers to come back to Germany. We document a slightly declining trend in return migration among more recent cohorts of researchers who left Germany, which, for most disciplines, was associated with a decrease in the German collaborative ties of these researchers.

In recent decades, research funding plays an increasingly important role in scientific research. Thus, it is progressively significant for management authorities to measure the research efficiency of highly funded scientists, which can be helpful for them to make effective policies. However, few researchers use quantitative analysis to study these issues. To promote the research in this field, we begin with collecting a dataset. This dataset contains research funding and other information from 345 highly funded scientists in Mainland China. Next, we use the dataset to measure the efficiency of highly funded scientists based on the data envelopment analysis. In this way, highly funded scientists are placed into several levels according to their research inputs and outputs. We also give their attractiveness and progress scores compared to other grades. The learning path for less efficient scientists is also provided. We find that highly funded scientists have relatively high efficiency in three kinds of projects, such as the Major Research Plan. Besides, the career length and career start year are demonstrated to have a limited impact on the highly funded scientists.

It argues that the essential theses of such a theory are metatheoretical. A theory of an science is in reality a metascience, reformulating the thesis of a theory of science without further precision, for the purposes of describing a specific object. Realism as a theory of an empirical legal science is thus a metascience derived from a set of theoretical theses that can be identified with logical positivism. The identification of a positive moral judgment depends on its mere existence and not on its merit or demerit relative to another moral judgment.

Bérdi M.,36112953600,"Budapest, Hungary",Bibliometric analysis of Hungarian-related publications in suicidal behavior research of the last three decades,"BACKGROUND: Digitized databases of scientific publications provide an opportunity to study the development and structure of science as a whole or a discipline. Qualitative methods of bibliometrics help with this, and the multidisciplinary approach, known as the ""Science of Science"", provides a thinking framework and methods. There is no example for the analysis of the bibliometric characteristics of Hungarian suicidology publications. METHOD: In this study, the author analyzes publications related to suicidal behavior published between 1992 and 2021, with the participation of at least one Hungarian author, using statistical, data visualization, and network analysis methods. The analysis used publications in English, Hungarian, and other languages found in the Scopus database. RESULTS: The present research could identify 426 Hungarian publications in the three decades examined. The number of studies increased 5.8 times between the first and last five-year periods. The growth is not linear; there was a sudden increase in the number of studies around 2004. The doubling time for the number of studies is 9.6 years. The analysis identified five larger and five smaller clusters in the authors' network of relationships, representing well-known domestic suicidal research groups. In suicidology, Lotka's law also applies to the Hungarian sample. That is, few authors write the majority of studies, while the vast majority write only a few publications during their careers. A study's average number of authors increased significantly during the examined period. Multi-author studies received significantly more citations than single-author studies. 74.4% of the announcements are in English, and 21.6% are in Hungarian. CONCLUSIONS: The methods of bibliometric analysis and the ""science of science"" can help research groups identify new research directions. All of this can ultimately contribute to a better understanding of suicidal behavior, allowing answering social and scientific problems. The focus of future bibliometric research, in addition to foreign databases, could be the analysis of a broader time interval with the help of Hungarian databases (e.g., MATARKA).",NA,Psychiatria Hungarica : A Magyar Pszichiatriai Tarsasag tudomanyos folyoirata,Article,2023,3,NA,Hungarian,NA

This concern is spurring numerous investigations into the variability of data analysis results. The findings demonstrate that different teams analyzing the same data may reach different conclusions. This is the “many-analysts” problem. Previous research on the many-analysts problem focused on demonstrating its existence, without identifying specific practices for solving it. We address this gap by identifying three pitfalls that have contributed to the variability observed in many-analysts publications and providing suggestions on how to avoid them.

We sought to characterize the language of publication and geographic origin of neurosurgical journals, delineate associations between impact factor (IF) and language and geographic variables, and describe steps to overcome language barriers to publishing. Methods: Web of Science, Scopus, and Ulrich's Serial Analysis system were searched for neurosurgery journals. The journals were screened for relevance. Language of publication, country and World Health Organization region, World Bank income status and gross domestic product, and citation metrics were extracted. Results: Of 867 journals, 74 neurosurgical journals were included. Common publication languages were English (52, 70.3%), Mandarin (5, 6.8%), and Spanish (4, 5.4%). Countries of publication for the greatest number of journals were the United States (23, 31.1%), United Kingdom (8, 10.8%), and China (6, 8.1%). Most journals originated from the Americas region (29, 39.2%), the European region (28, 37.8%), and from high-income countries (n = 54, 73.0%). Median IF was 1.55 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.89–2.40).

However, despite their critical role, N-S collaborations on datasets are not well understood. Science of science studies tend to rely on publications and patents to examine N-S collaboration patterns. To this end, the rise of global crises requiring N-S collaborations to produce and share data presents an urgent need to understand the prevalence, dynamics, and political economy of N-S collaborations on research datasets. In this paper, we employ a mixed methods case study research approach to analyze the frequency of and division of labor in N-S collaborations on datasets submitted to GenBank over 29 years (1992–2021). We find: (1) there is a low representation of N-S collaborations over the 29-year period. When they do occur, N-S collaborations display “burstiness” patterns, suggesting that N-S collaborations on datasets are formed and maintained reactively in the wake of global health crises such as infectious disease outbreaks; (2) The division of labor between datasets and publications is disproportionate to the global south in the early years, but becomes more overlapping after 2003. An exception in the case of countries with lower S&T capacity but high income, where these countries have a higher prevalence on datasets (e.g., United Arab Emirates). We qualitatively inspect a sample of N-S dataset collaborations to identify leadership patterns in dataset and publication authorship. The findings lead us to argue there is a need to include N-S dataset collaborations in measures of research outputs to nuance the current models and assessment tools of equity in N-S collaborations. The paper contributes to the SGDs objectives to develop data-driven metrics that can inform scientific collaborations on research datasets.

Miłkowski M.,35148139000,"Institute of Philosophy and Sociology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poland",Cognitive Artifacts and Their Virtues in Scientific Practice,"One of the critical issues in the philosophy of science is to understand scientific knowledge. This paper proposes a novel approach to the study of reflection on science, called ""cognitive metascience"". In particular, it offers a new understanding of scientific knowledge as constituted by various kinds of scientific representations, framed as cognitive artifacts. It introduces a novel functional taxonomy of cognitive artifacts prevalent in scientific practice, covering a huge diversity of their formats, vehicles, and functions. As a consequence, toolboxes, conceptual frameworks, theories, models, and individual hypotheses can be understood as artifacts supporting our cognitive performance. It is also shown that by empirically studying how artifacts function, we may discover hitherto undiscussed virtues and vices of these scientific representations. This paper relies on the use of language technology to analyze scientific discourse empirically, which allows us to uncover the metascientific views of researchers. This, in turn, can become part of normative considerations concerning virtues and vices of cognitive artifacts.  © 2022 Marcin Miłkowski, published by Sciendo.",cognitive artifacts; cognitive metascience; scientific knowledge; scientific practice; virtues,"Studies in Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric",Article,2022,2,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.2478/slgr-2022-0012

While useful progress has been made, to date, the majority of discussions surrounding psychology's measurement crisis have involved technical, quantitative investigations into the validity, reliability, and statistical robustness of psychological measures. This registered report offers a seldom-heard qualitative perspective on these ongoing debates, critically exploring members of the general public's (i.e., non-experts) lay perceptions of widely used measures in psychology. Using a combination of cognitive interviews and a think aloud study protocol, participants (n = 23) completed one of three popular psychology measures. Participants reflected on each of the measures, discussed the contents, and provided perceptions of what the measures are designed to test. Coding of the think aloud protocols showed that participants across the measures had issues in interpreting and responding to items. Thematic analysis of the cognitive interviews identified three dominant themes that each relate to lay perceptions of psychology measurements. These were: (1) participants' grappling with attempting to 'capture their multiple selves' in the questionnaires, (2) participants perceiving the questionnaire method as generally 'missing nuance and richness' and (3) exposing the 'hidden labour of questionnaires'. These findings are discussed in the context of psychology's measurement reform. © The Author(s), 2023.",cognitive interview; credibility crisis; measurement crisis; metascience; qualitative research; think aloud,Social Psychological Bulletin,Article,2023,4,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.32872/spb.9383

These efforts often neglect the influence of researchers’ environment. Acknowledgments in dissertation subsections shed light on this environment by providing an opportunity for students to thank the people who supported them. We analysed 26,236 acknowledgments to create an “academic support network” that reveals five distinct communities that support students along the way: Academic, Administration, Family, Friends & Colleagues, and Spiritual. We show that female students mention fewer people from each of these communities, with the exception of their families, and that their productivity is slightly lower than that of males when considering the number of publications alone. This is critically important because it means that studying the doctoral process may help us better understand the adverse conditions women face early in their academic careers. Our results also suggest that the total number of people mentioned in the acknowledgements allows disciplines to be categorised as either individual science or team science as their magnitudes change. We also show that male students who mention more people from their academic community are associated with higher levels of productivity. University rankings are found to be positively correlated with productivity and the size of academic support networks. However, neither university rankings nor students’ productivity levels correlate with the sentiments students express in their acknowledgements. Our results point to the importance of academic support networks by explaining how they differ and how they influence productivity. © 2022, The Author(s).",Network science; Science of science; Scientific careers; Text mining,EPJ Data Science,Article,2022,1,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00369-z

However, bilingualism is not a homogenous experience that can be easily categorized. By clarifying participants' language experiences, research findings can be more meaningful for clinicians and practitioners. In this systematic review, we document how the language experiences of samples with and without ASD were described in 103 peer-reviewed journal articles. We observed that language experiences were characterized using a wide range of labels and descriptions. Approximately half of the studies in this review reported participants' language acquisition history, and 64% of the studies defined language proficiency using standardized measures or parental reports. However, <20% of the studies reported daily language exposure and/or usage of the participants. The diversity in how participants' language experiences were characterized in research reflects the complexity of bilingualism. Yet, to further understand how ASD and bilingualism intersect across studies, to facilitate meta-science development, and to balance generalizability with specificity, reporting common characteristics of bilingual experiences is recommended.

Being an essential element of the economics of science, it has become a matter of scientific inquiry attracting efforts from fields as different as network analysis and bibliometrics. The studies have provided insights into the local structure of collaboration networks, relations between the team composition and research impact. However, the laws governing research collaboration at the (macro)scale of countries and institutions are yet to be established. In this work, a simple yet unexpectedly accurate logarithmic relation between measures of the research output and self-reliance is demonstrated. Restriction of co-authorship analysis to high-ranking journals suppresses geographical and cultural differences to expose universalities in the international research collaboration. The emerging law holds across research areas; it benchmarks collaboration patterns of research institutions grouped by type or country. The self-organized regularity of the collaboration dynamics manifests an important role of national research systems in globalized science, may have profound implications for research policy development and implementation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",International research collaboration; Nature Index; Research output; Research policy; Science of science,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,Article,2023,0,NA,English,10.1016/j.physa.2022.128437

This imbalance can be seen at several levels, including in university and industry, where men are the majority of the posts. Academic success is partly dependent on the value of the researchers’ co-authorship networks. One of the ways to enrich one’s network is through academic movement; the change of institutions in search of better opportunities within the same country or internationally. In this paper, we look at the data for one specific pSTEM field, Computer Science, and describe the productivity and co-authorship patterns that emerge as a function of academic mobility. We find that women and men both benefit from national and international mobility, women who never change affiliations over their career are rarely well-cited or highly productive, and women are not well-represented in the overall top-ranking researchers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Academic mobility; Data science; Gender inequality; Network science; Science of science,Springer Proceedings in Complexity,Conference paper,2023,0,NA,English,10.1007/978-3-031-28276-8_11

The comments are made in the light of considerations on the methodology of the historiography of science, including the author’s ideas of research hermeneutics and the research hermeneutics of the historiography of science, the biography of Boris Hessen, the history of scientific historiography, the history of science and the history of science-of-science. The article synthetically presents Hessen’s research hermeneutics and points to its fundamental disadvantages. It describes the reception of Hessen’s paper in the West: both the more widely known positive reception (of Bernalists and their successors, including supporters of Marxist studies of science and the social history of science), and the much less known negative reception (members of the (British) Society for Freedom in Science, members of the Harvard group of J. B. Conant of General Education in Science). The article also presents the changing fate of the reception of Hessen’s thoughts in the USSR and Russia in the years 1930–2020. Additionally, it indicates various historiographic myths related to “Boris Hessen”, including the myth that the Polish science-of-science (Polish: naukoznawstwo) emerged later or at the same time as Russian science-of-science (Russian: науковедение, naukovedenie). The defectiveness of Hessen’s research hermeneutics on the one hand, and on the other hand the reception of his views in the West and in the USSR and Russia from the 1930s to the 2020s, including the various historiographic myths related to Hessen, show how paradoxical the history of the historiography of science can be, and demonstrate the need to cultivate the skills of critical thinking among researchers interpreting science (i.e. historians of science, philosophers of science, sociologists of scientific knowledge, etc.). © 2022, Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences,Commission on the History of Science.

Despite decades-long efforts to increase gender diversity, however, women remain a small minority in many fields, especially in senior positions. The dearth of elite women scientists, in turn, leaves fewer women to serve as mentors and role models for young women scientists. To shed light on gender disparities in science, we study prominent scholars who were elected to the National Academy of Sciences. We construct author citation networks that capture the structure of recognition among scholars’ peers. We identify gender disparities in the patterns of peer citations and show that these differences are strong enough to accurately predict the scholar’s gender. In contrast, we do not observe disparities due to prestige, with few significant differences in the structure of citations of scholars affiliated with high-ranked and low-ranked institutions. These results provide further evidence that a scholar’s gender plays a role in the mechanisms of success in science. Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

However, citation count is susceptible to well-documented variations in citation practices across time and discipline, limiting our ability to compare different scientific achievements. Previous efforts to account for citation variations often rely on a priori discipline labels of papers, assuming that all papers in a discipline are identical in their subject matter. Here, we propose a network-based methodology to quantify the impact of an article by comparing it with locally comparable research, thereby eliminating the discipline label requirement. We show that the developed measure is not susceptible to discipline bias and follows a universal distribution for all articles published in different years, offering an unbiased indicator for impact across time and discipline. We then use the indicator to identify science-wide high impact research in the past half century and quantify its temporal production dynamics across disciplines, helping us identifying breakthroughs from diverse, smaller disciplines, such as geosciences, radiology, and optics, as opposed to citation-rich biomedical sciences. Our work provides insights into the evolution of science and paves a way for fair comparisons of the impact of diverse contributions across many fields. Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

A robust evidence basis shows that such trust is associated with belief in misinformation and willingness to engage in public and personal health behaviors. At the same time, trust and the associated construct of credibility are complex meta-cognitive concepts that often are oversimplified in quantitative research. The discussion of research often includes both normative language (what one ought to do based on a study’s findings) and cognitive language (what a study found), but these types of claims are very different, since normative claims make assumptions about people’s interests. Thus, this paper presents a protocol for a large randomized controlled trial to experimentally test whether some of the variability in trust in science and scientists and perceived message credibility is attributable to the use of normative language when sharing study findings in contrast to the use of cognitive language alone. Objective: The objective of this trial will be to examine if reading normative and cognitive claims about a scientific study, compared to cognitive claims alone, results in lower trust in science and scientists as well as lower perceived credibility of the scientist who conducted the study, perceived credibility of the research, trust in the scientific information on the post, and trust in scientific information coming from the author of the post. Methods: We will conduct a randomized controlled trial consisting of 2 parallel groups and a 1:1 allocation ratio. A sample of 1500 adults aged ≥18 years who represent the overall US population distribution by gender, race/ethnicity, and age will randomly be assigned to either an “intervention” arm (normative and cognitive claims) or a control arm (cognitive claims alone). In each arm, participants will view and verify their understanding of an ecologically valid claim or set of claims (ie, from a highly cited, published research study) designed to look like a social media post. Outcomes will be trust in science and scientists, the perceived credibility of the scientist who conducted the study, the perceived credibility of the research, trust in the scientific information on the post, and trust in scientific information coming from the author of the post. Analyses will incorporate 9 covariates. Results: This study will be conducted without using any external funding mechanisms. Conclusions: If there is a measurable effect attributable to the inclusion of normative language when writing about scientific findings, it should generate discussion about how such findings are presented and disseminated. ©Jon Agley, Yunyu Xiao, Esi E Thompson, Lilian Golzarri-Arroyo.",cognitive; COVID-19; credibility; credible; infodemic; meta-cognitive; meta-science; misinformation; normative language; randomized controlled trial; RCT; scientific communication; scientific information; trust; trust in science,JMIR Research Protocols,Article,2022,2,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.2196/41747

In addition to conducting rigorous research, there are social strategies that influence authors’ and their papers’ level of citations. The author’s position in the co-authorship network affects the success of their papers. Hence, we want to understand if the authors’ segregation in the co-authorship network relates to citations gained by a paper over time. We address this question by examining the patterns in Computer Science from 1975 to 2015 (and citations until 2020) from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus. Specifically, we identify communities in the co-authorship network and classify them into segregation categories and core positions. Then, we compare the citation histories of papers written in those communities. We examine papers written solely by members of the same community (internal) and different communities (external), resulting in the following five categories: internal highly-segregated, internal non-segregated, external highly-segregated, external non-segregated, and external mixed. Our results show that from 1998 to 2010, internal highly-segregated papers gained fewer citations than internal non-segregated and external mixed papers. Also, from 2010 to 2015, external mixed papers gained more citations than internal non-segregated papers and even more citations than internal highly-segregated papers. We also found that in the network nucleus (from core decomposition), there is little difference in the citations of internal non- and highly-segregated papers. In contrast, in the network’s periphery, internal non-segregated papers tend to gain more citations than internal highly-segregated papers since 2005. From this work, we conclude that papers written by a more diverse set of authors (measured by their network connectivity) receive more citations over time and that to compensate for the lack of diversity, their authors should be in central positions of the co-authorship network. Hence, this work could incentivise diverse co-authorships and strengthen researchers’ cohesion to increase their papers’ success. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Citations attainment; Co-authorship networks; Science of science,Springer Proceedings in Complexity,Conference paper,2023,0,NA,English,10.1007/978-3-031-28276-8_13

Here, we suggest that both individuals and psychology as a field can better improve human welfare by incorporating ideas from effective altruism, a growing movement whose members aim to do the most good by using science and reason to inform their efforts. In this article, we first briefly introduce effective altruism and review important principles that can be applied to how psychologists approach their work, such as the importance, tractability, and neglectedness framework. We then review how effective altruism can inform individual psychologists’ choices. Finally, we close with a discussion of ideas for how psychology, as a field, can increase its positive impact. By applying insights from effective altruism to psychological science, we aim to integrate a new theoretical framework into psychological science, stimulate new areas of research, start a discussion on how psychology can maximize its impact, and inspire the psychology community to do the most good. © The Author(s) 2022.",effective altruism; metascience,Perspectives on Psychological Science,Article,2023,7,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1177/17456916221079596

However, large corpora have remained unanalyzed in depth, as descriptive labels are absent and require expert domain knowledge to generate. We propose a novel weakly supervised transformer-based architecture for computing joint representations of code from both abstract syntax trees and surrounding natural language comments. We then evaluate the model on a new classification task for labeling computational notebook cells as stages in the data analysis process from data import to wrangling, exploration, modeling, and evaluation. We show that our model, leveraging only easily-available weak supervision, achieves a 38% increase in accuracy over expert-supplied heuristics and outperforms a suite of baselines. Our model enables us to examine a set of 118,000 Jupyter Notebooks to uncover common data analysis patterns. Focusing on notebooks with relationships to academic articles, we conduct the largest study of scientific code to date and find that notebooks which devote an higher fraction of code to the typically labor-intensive process of wrangling data in expectation exhibit decreased citation counts for corresponding papers. We also show significant differences between academic and non-academic notebooks, including that academic notebooks devote substantially more code to wrangling and exploring data, and less on modeling. © 2022, The Author(s).",Data science; Meta science; Representation learning,EPJ Data Science,Article,2022,6,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00327-9

However, the pedagogy of science demonstrations has been criticized as creating a power imbalance between the presenter and audience, for being too far removed from the audience’s prior experiences, and for lacking interactivity. We report here on an intervention that designed demonstration-experiments to address a lack of interactivity while supporting interest; contextualized demonstrations within everyday experiences to address a lack of prior experiences and support interest, and implemented a near-peer role modeling strategy through high school near-peer role models to address power imbalances while supporting self-efficacy and expanding fourth-grade students’ perceptions of who can be a scientist. The study explores the effects of the intervention using a pre-post survey design analyzed by repeated measures multiple analysis of variance (rmMANOVA) (n = 444). Significant improvement was observed for all motivational variables.

The trustworthiness, rigor, and transparency of GT qualitative data analysis can benefit, among others, when multiple analysts juxtapose diverse perspectives and collaborate to develop a common code frame based on a consensual and consistent interpretation. Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) and/or Inter-Rater Agreement (IRA) are commonly used techniques to measure consensus, and thus develop a shared interpretation. However, minimal guidance is available about how and when to measure IRR/IRA during the iterative process of GT, so researchers have been using ad hoc methods for years. Objective: This paper presents a process for systematically measuring IRR/IRA in GT studies, when appropriate, which is grounded in a previous systematic mapping study on collaborative GT in the field of software engineering. Methods: Meta-science guided us to analyze the issues and challenges of collaborative GT and formalize a process to measure IRR/IRA in GT. Results: This process guides researchers to incrementally generate a theory while ensuring consensus on the constructs that support it, improving trustworthiness, rigor, and transparency, and promoting the communicability, reflexivity, and replicability of the research. Conclusion: The application of this process to a GT study seems to support its feasibility. In the absence of further confirmation, this would represent the first step in a de facto standard to be applied to those GT studies that may benefit from IRR/IRA techniques. © 2022",Grounded Theory; Inter-Rater Agreement; Inter-Rater Reliability,Journal of Systems and Software,Article,2023,12,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1016/j.jss.2022.111520

In this essay, I propose a solution informed by the work of Imre Lakatos and his methodology of scientific research programmes (MSRP). I begin by reviewing several notable attempts at appraising journal quality – focusing primarily on the impact factor and development of journal blacklists and whitelists. In doing so, I note their limitations and link their overarching goals to those found within the philosophy of science. I argue that Lakatos’s MSRP and specifically his classifications of “progressive” and “degenerative” research programmes can be analogized and repurposed for the evaluation of scholarly journals. I argue that this alternative framework resolves some of the limitations discussed above and offers a more considered evaluation of journal quality – one that helps account for the historical evolution of journal-level publication practices and attendant contributions to the growth (or stunting) of scholarly knowledge. By doing so, the seeming problem of journal demarcation is diminished. In the process I utilize two novel tools (the mistake index and scite index) to further illustrate and operationalize aspects of the MSRP. © 2022, Springer Nature B.V.",Journalology; Meta-science; Methodology of scientific research programmes; Predatory publishing; Scholarly publishing; Sociology of science,European Journal for Philosophy of Science,Article,2022,7,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1007/s13194-022-00492-8

However, a number of findings published in journals with high impact factors have failed to replicate, suggesting that impact alone may not be an accurate indicator of quality. Fraley and Vazire proposed an alternative index, the N-pact factor, which indexes the median sample size of published studies, providing a narrow but relevant indicator of research quality. In the present research, we expand on the original report by examining the N-pact factor of social/personality-psychology journals between 2011 and 2019, incorporating additional journals and accounting for study design (i.e., between persons, repeated measures, and mixed). There was substantial variation in the sample sizes used in studies published in different journals. Journals that emphasized personality processes and individual differences had larger N-pact factors than journals that emphasized social-psychological processes. Moreover, N-pact factors were largely independent of traditional markers of impact. Although the majority of journals in 2011 published studies that were not well powered to detect an effect of ρ =.20, this situation had improved considerably by 2019. In 2019, eight of the nine journals we sampled published studies that were, on average, powered at 80% or higher to detect such an effect. After decades of unheeded warnings from methodologists about the dangers of small-sample designs, the field of social/personality psychology has begun to use larger samples. We hope the N-pact factor will be supplemented by other indices that can be used as alternatives to improve further the evaluation of research. © The Author(s) 2022.",metascience; methods; open data; open materials; replication; statistical power,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,Article,2022,9,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1177/25152459221120217

I start by briefly introducing both the structuralist approach and the problem of lost reality and discussing the various (non-structuralist) solutions that have been proposed in the literature. Following this, I decompose the problem into the ontological mismatch and specification problems. In response to the former, I present a metascientific dissolution argument, according to which the difference in kind between mathematical structures and physical systems poses no deep obstacle to the structuralist approach, and consider some upshots of this argument for our views on representation. By way of conclusion, I argue that the metascientific dissolution argument paves the way for a solution to the specification problem as well. © 2022, The Author(s).",Inferentialism; Lost reality; Metascience; Structuralism,Journal for General Philosophy of Science,Article,2022,0,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1007/s10838-022-09604-7

It is unsurprising, then, that science itself is rooted in metaphor and analogy for creating meaning. However, to understand the development of these phenomena and their consequences on society, most natural language processing solutions have tended to be merely based on prior quantifications of topics or lower level linguistic features. This work aims at bridging this gap by exploiting state-of-the-art knowledge extraction and representation techniques to discover and model knowledge patterns (KPs) in scientific texts. The hybridization of natural language processing and semantic technologies will foster the formalization and extraction of KPs from text used in a non-literal sense and abstractive form. Specifically, this work will: (i) detect tropes in a curated corpus; (ii) explore their relationship with other structural elements of the text; (iii) identify and formalize invariances into KPs and (iv) populate a knowledge graph based on this metamodel.

These surprising results have inspired a body of metascientific research aimed at understanding these failures to replicate and ensuring future research is credible. In this article, we relate these new insights from metascience to empirical legal research. Specifically, a recent effort to replicate three influential empirical legal studies published in law journals found results that diverged from the originals. The replicators suggested their results were caused by the changing social context and did not explicitly consider whether the original effects were overstated or false positives. We re-analysed the data from the replications to attempt to confirm their results (i.e., computational reproducibility) with mixed success. When possible, we combined the data from the replications (i.e., meta-analysis) to leverage the greater precision that comes with large sample sizes. In one case, we found an effect where the replicators did not. Overall, however, our re-analysis and review of the broader social scientific context suggests that empirical legal research suffers from the same challenges plaguing other fields - small sample sizes and undisclosed flexibility have produced untrustworthy results. © 2022 Liverpool University Press.

The tools of network science were used to quantify the extent to which Psychology is multidisciplinary, and how the extent to which it is multidisciplinary changed over time. Citation networks were created from all of the articles published in journals identified by the Web of Science as Multidisciplinary-Psychology for each year from 2008 to 2018. Nodes in the networks represented Multidisciplinary-Psychology journals, and connections were placed to other journals (i.e., nodes) that were cited in the Multidisciplinary-Psychology articles for each year. The citation networks showed that about 25% of the citations were to other Multidisciplinary-Psychology journals, about 50% of the citations were to Psychology journals in other sub-fields, and about 25% of the citations were to journals in other disciplines. This distribution of citations remained fairly consistent across the years examined. To identify the ways in which Psychology is multidisciplinary, clusters of nodes (known as modules) in each citation network were detected to identify possible research themes that were examined further with co-word networks made from the author-provided keywords in each of the Multidisciplinary-Psychology articles that appeared in each Module. Some research topics persisted in the years examined, whereas other topics were more transient. Given that multidisciplinary research did not increase over time but instead changed in areas of research focus, ways for academic and research administrators to foster and continually renew multidisciplinary research are discussed. The discussion also describes how individual researchers might use the techniques here to identify areas of research that are less commonly explored and may prove to be fruitful areas to shift their research focus. The same techniques can be used to provide insight in to other disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences. © 2022, The Author(s).",NA,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,Article,2022,4,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1057/s41599-022-01175-8

Team power dynamics can be measured by team power level and team power hierarchy. Team power level is conceptualized as the average level of the possession of resources, expertise, or decision-making authorities of a team. Team power hierarchy represents the vertical differences of the possessions of resources in a team. In Science of Science, few studies have looked at scientific collaboration from the perspective of team power dynamics. This research examines how team power dynamics affect team impact to fill the research gap. In this research, all coauthors of one publication are treated as one team. Team power level and team power hierarchy of one team are measured by the mean and Gini index of career age of coauthors in this team. Team impact is quantified by citations of a paper authored by this team. By analyzing over 7.7 million teams from Science (e.g., Computer Science, Physics), Social Sciences (e.g., Sociology, Library & Information Science), and Arts & Humanities (e.g., Art), we find that flat team structure is associated with higher team impact, especially when teams have high team power level. These findings have been repeated in all five disciplines except Art, and are consistent in various types of teams from Computer Science including teams from industry or academia, teams with different gender groups, teams with geographical contrast, and teams with distinct size. © 2022 Association for Information Science and Technology.",NA,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,Article,2022,16,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1002/asi.24653

Artificial intelligence is one of the fastest growing and promising technologies for processing and classifying natural text. The objective is to conduct a semantic analysis of domestic publications on emergency-related medical, biological and psychological problems, that are registered in the Russian Science Citation Index within 2005-2021 and where authors implement artificial intelligence methods and special software. Method. The object of the study is to analyze emergency-related medical, biological and psychological problems, published within 2005-2021 and registered in the Russian Science Citation Index. The analysis was carried out using VOSviewer program, as well as a neural network using the Python programming language. Results and discussion. For the purpose of semantic analysis, numerous scientific articles were imported from the Russian Science Citation Index into the VOSviewer program. Bibliometric visualization and clustering of key terms was conducted, to provide an insight into the publications and affiliations of main authors. In addition, cluster analysis and the 'elbow' method allowed to build a neural network in an automated mode to provide for more effective clustering; these data enabled us to identify 19 thematic clusters of scientific publications. Conclusion. In their publications investigators should be aware that the language of abstracts and keywords shall be inconformity with thesauruses, such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). These clarifications contribute to a more correct correlation between publications and existing headings. Further increase in the level of digitalization, including artificial intelligence methods, will allow to conduct more accurate research. © 2023 Nikiforov Russian Center of Emergency and Radiation Medicine, EMERCOM of Russia.

Most discussions of reliability problems in science focus on systematic biases. We broaden the lens to emphasize the idiosyncrasy of conscious and unconscious decisions that researchers make during data analysis. We coordinated 161 researchers in 73 research teams and observed their research decisions as they used the same data to independently test the same prominent social science hypothesis: that greater immigration reduces support for social policies among the public. In this typical case of social science research, research teams reported both widely diverging numerical findings and substantive conclusions despite identical start conditions. Researchers’ expertise, prior beliefs, and expectations barely predict the wide variation in research outcomes. More than 95% of the total variance in numerical results remains unexplained even after qualitative coding of all identifiable decisions in each team’s workflow. This reveals a universe of uncertainty that remains hidden when considering a single study in isolation. The idiosyncratic nature of how researchers’ results and conclusions varied is a previously underappreciated explanation for why many scientific hypotheses remain contested.

The concept of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) provides a framework that integrates dispersed research efforts aiming to understand the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of applying open and collaborative research practices. While the OIS framework has already been taken up by science of science scholars, its conceptual underpinnings require further specification. In this essay, we critically examine the OIS concept and bring to light two key aspects: 1) how OIS builds upon Open Innovation (OI) research by adopting its attention to boundary-crossing knowledge flows and by adapting other concepts developed and researched in OI to the science context, as exemplified by two OIS cases in the area of research funding; 2) how OIS conceptualises knowledge flows across boundaries. While OI typically focuses on well-defined organisational boundaries, we argue that blurry and even invisible boundaries between communities of practice may more strongly constrain flows of knowledge related to openness and collaboration in science. Given the uptake of this concept, this essay brings needed clarity to the meaning of OIS, which has no particular normative orientation towards a close coupling between science and industry. We end by outlining the essay’s contributions to OI and the science of science, as well as to science practitioners. © 2021 The Author(s).

Central to this challenge is re-establishing ground truths or the most fundamental theories that serve as the bedrock to a scientific community. However, the goal to identify hypotheses with the greatest support is non-trivial given the unprecedented rate of scientific publishing. In this era of high-volume science, the goal of this study is to sample from one research community within clinical neuroscience (traumatic brain injury) and track major trends that have shaped this literature over the past 50 years. To do so, we first conduct a decade-wise (1980-2019) network analysis to examine the scientific communities that shape this literature. To establish the robustness of our findings, we utilized searches from separate search engines (Web of Science; Semantic Scholar). As a second goal, we sought to determine the most highly cited hypotheses influencing the literature in each decade. In a third goal, we then searched for any papers referring to 'replication' or efforts to reproduce findings within our >50 000 paper dataset. From this search, 550 papers were analysed to determine the frequency and nature of formal replication studies over time. Finally, to maximize transparency, we provide a detailed procedure for the creation and analysis of our dataset, including a discussion of each of our major decision points, to facilitate similar efforts in other areas of neuroscience. We found that the unparalleled rate of scientific publishing within the brain injury literature combined with the scarcity of clear hypotheses in individual publications is a challenge to both evaluating accepted findings and determining paths forward to accelerate science. Additionally, while the conversation about reproducibility has increased over the past decade, the rate of published replication studies continues to be a negligible proportion of the research. Meta-science and computational methods offer the critical opportunity to assess the state of the science and illuminate pathways forward, but ultimately there is structural change needed in the brain injury literature and perhaps others.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Recently many studies on the evolution of science have been conducted in the context of the emergent Science of Science field. While many studies have probed the link problem in citation networks, only a few works have analyzed the temporal nature of link prediction in author citation networks. In this study we compared the performance of 10 well-known local network similarity measurements with four machine learning models to predict future links in author citations networks. Differently from traditional link prediction methods, the temporal nature of the predict links is relevant for our approach. Our analysis revealed that the Jaccard coefficient was found to be among the most relevant measurements. The preferential attachment measurement, conversely, displayed the worst performance. We also found that the extension of local measurements to their weighted version do not significantly improved the performance of predicting citations. Finally, we also found that a XGBoost and neural network approach summarizing the information from all 10 considered similarity measurements was able to provide the highest AUC performance and competitive precision values. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Authors citation networks; Citation networks; Link prediction; Network similarity; Science of science,Scientometrics,Article,2022,11,NA,English,10.1007/s11192-022-04484-6

We tackle this question with a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 57 disciplines, examining the publications of more than 5 million authors whose careers started between 1986 and 2008. We calibrate a simple random walk model over historical data of ranking mobility, which we use to 1) identify which strata of academic impact rankings are the most/least mobile and 2) study the temporal evolution of mobility. By focusing our analysis on cohorts of authors starting their careers in the same year, we find that ranking mobility is remarkably low for the top- and bottom-ranked authors and that this excess of stability persists throughout the entire period of our analysis. We further observe that mobility of impact rankings has increased over time, and that such rise has been accompanied by a decline of impact inequality, which is consistent with the negative correlation that we observe between such two quantities. These findings provide clarity on the opportunities of new scholars entering the academic community, with implications for academic policymaking. Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

These real-world examples provide unique learning opportunities for research methodologists and clinical epidemiologists-in-training. Dr. David Moher, a recognized expert on the science of research reporting and one of the founders of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, was a guest speaker for the 2021 Hooker Distinguished Visiting Professor Lecture series at McMaster University and shared his insights about these issues. Main text: This paper covers a discussion on the influence of reporting guidelines on trials and issues with the use of CONSORT as a measure of quality. Dr. Moher also addresses how the overwhelming body of COVID-19 research reflects the “publish or perish” paradigm in academia and why improvement in the reporting of trials requires policy initiatives from research institutions and funding agencies. We also discuss the rise of publication bias and other questionable reporting practices. To combat this, Dr. Moher believes open science and training initiatives led by institutions can foster research integrity, including the trustworthiness of researchers, institutions, and journals, as well as counter threats posed by predatory journals. He highlights how metrics like journal impact factor and quantity of publications also harm research integrity. Dr. Moher also discussed the importance of meta-science, the study of how research is carried out, which can help to evaluate audit and feedback systems and their effect on open science practices. Conclusion: Dr. Moher advocates for policy to further improve the reporting of trials and health research. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed how a lack of open science practices and flawed systems incentivizing researchers to publish can harm research integrity. There is a need for a culture shift in assessing careers and “productivity” in academia, and this requires collaborative top-down and bottom-up approaches. © 2022, The Author(s).",Clinical trials; Collaborative research; Education; Open science; Publishing; Reporting guidelines; Research integrity,Trials,Article,2022,7,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1186/s13063-022-06624-y

Given that power analyses are infrequently reported in dysphagia research, it remains unclear whether studies are adequately powered to detect a range of treatment effects. Therefore, this review sought to examine the current landscape of statistical power in swallowing rehabilitation research. Databases were searched for swallowing treatments using instrumental evaluations of swallowing and the penetration–aspiration scale as an outcome. Sensitivity power analyses based on each study’s statistical test and sample size were performed to determine the minimum effect size detectable with 80% power. Eighty-nine studies with 94 treatment comparisons were included. Sixty-seven percent of treatment comparisons were unable to detect effects smaller than d = 0.80. The smallest detectable effect size was d = 0.29 for electrical stimulation, d = 0.49 for postural maneuvers, d = 0.52 for non-invasive brain stimulation, d = 0.61 for combined treatments, d = 0.63 for respiratory-based interventions, d = 0.70 for lingual strengthening, and d = 0.79 for oral sensory stimulation. Dysphagia treatments examining changes in penetration–aspiration scale scores were generally powered to reliably detect larger effect sizes and not smaller (but potentially clinically meaningful) effects. These findings suggest that non-significant results may be related to low statistical power, highlighting the need for collaborative, well-powered intervention studies that can detect smaller, clinically meaningful changes in swallowing function.

To achieve the objective, the study employed a precise and systematic procedure to gather 562 journal articles published in Scopus-indexed journals from 1926–2022. Subsequently, VOSviewer, Science of Science (Sci2), and Gephi were utilized to conduct bibliometric analysis (such as keyword co-occurrence and bibliographic coupling) and network analysis tests (such as citation and co-citation analysis). The results of keyword co-occurrence and co-citation analysis suggest there are three knowledge clusters: welfare provisions, benefits provided by social insurance, and social insurance operational aspects.

However, the method has disadvantages: Not only is it perceived as effortful and time-consuming, but reasonable deviations from the analysis plan demote the status of the study to exploratory. An alternative to preregistration is analysis blinding, in which researchers develop their analysis on an altered version of the data. In this experimental study, we compare the reported efficiency and convenience of the two methods in the context of the Many-Analysts Religion Project. In this project, 120 teams answered the same research questions on the same data set, either preregistering their analysis (n = 61) or using analysis blinding (n = 59). Our results provide strong evidence (Bayes factor [BF] = 71.40) for the hypothesis that analysis blinding leads to fewer deviations from the analysis plan, and if teams deviated, they did so on fewer aspects. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found strong evidence (BF = 13.19) that both methods required approximately the same amount of time. Finally, we found no and moderate evidence on whether analysis blinding was perceived as less effortful and frustrating, respectively. We conclude that analysis blinding does not mean less work, but researchers can still benefit from the method because they can plan more appropriate analyses from which they deviate less frequently. © The Author(s) 2023.",many analysts; metascience; Open Data; Open Materials; Open Science; Preregistration; replication crisis,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,Article,2023,5,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1177/25152459221128319

In this work, we develop and validate an interpretable approach for measuring scholarly jargon from text. Expanding the scope of prior work which focuses on word types, we use word sense induction to also identify words that are widespread but overloaded with different meanings across fields. We then estimate the prevalence of these discipline-specific words and senses across hundreds of subfields, and show that word senses provide a complementary, yet unique view of jargon alongside word types. We demonstrate the utility of our metrics for science of science and computational sociolinguistics by highlighting two key social implications. First, though most fields reduce their use of jargon when writing for general-purpose venues, and some fields (e.g., biological sciences) do so less than others. Second, the direction of correlation between jargon and citation rates varies among fields, but jargon is nearly always negatively correlated with interdisciplinary impact. Broadly, our findings suggest that though multidisciplinary venues intend to cater to more general audiences, some fields' writing norms may act as barriers rather than bridges, and thus impede the dispersion of scholarly ideas. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.",NA,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,Conference paper,2023,6,NA,English,NA

E.","Dickins has made some thoughtful suggestions as to why the important contributions of inclusive fitness theory have not been more celebrated by the proponents of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis, considering the extent to which inclusive fitness theory has accommodated and illuminated—and, indeed, been motivated by—their “laundry list” of supposedly neglected evolutionary factors. We agree that this oversight could be explained, in part, by their seeing inclusive fitness as a “monist” alternative to a more “pluralist” multilevel selection that was not part of the Modern Synthesis. Here we clarify that multilevel selection and inclusive fitness are not competing explanations, but rather they address orthogonal issues, concerning the process of selection and the purpose of adaptation, respectively. We discuss the sense in which inclusive fitness is “monist” in providing the only generally correct adaptive maximand, but also “pluralist” in the sense of accommodating a diversity of adaptive agents. We also emphasise that multilevel selection was, in fact, part of the Modern Synthesis and, indeed, its inadequacies as a theory of organismal adaptation provided a crucial motivation for the concept of inclusive fitness. © 2023, The Author(s).",Levels of biological organisation; Maximisation principle; Meta-science; Natural selection; Purpose of adaptation; Shifting balance,Evolutionary Biology - New Perspectives on its Development,Book chapter,2023,0,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1007/978-3-031-22028-9_22

The range of different definitions proposed within NLP/ML not only do not agree with each other, they are also not aligned with standard scientific definitions. This article examines the standard definitions of repeatability and reproducibility provided by the meta-science of metrology, and explores what they imply in terms of how to assess reproducibility, and what adopting them would mean for reproducibility assessment in NLP/ML. It turns out the standard definitions lead directly to a method for assessing reproducibility in quantified terms that renders results from reproduction studies comparable across multiple reproductions of the same original study, as well as reproductions of different original studies. The article considers where this method sits in relation to other aspects of NLP work one might wish to assess in the context of reproducibility. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",NA,Computational Linguistics,Article,2022,26,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1162/coli_a_00448

Preregistration of the hypotheses and methods of an empirical study before analysis, the sharing of primary research data, and compliance with data standards such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), are considered effective practices to secure progress and to substantiate quality of research. We investigated the current level of adoption of open science practices in neuroimaging and the difficulties that prevent researchers from using them. Email invitations to participate in the survey were sent to addresses received through a PubMed search of human functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that were published between 2010 and 2020. 283 persons completed the questionnaire. Although half of the participants were experienced with preregistration, the willingness to preregister studies in the future was modest. The majority of participants had experience with the sharing of primary neuroimaging data. Most of the participants were interested in implementing a standardized data structure such as BIDS in their labs. Based on demographic variables, we compared participants on seven subscales, which had been generated through factor analysis. Exploratory analyses found that experienced researchers at lower career level had higher fear of being transparent and researchers with residence in the EU had a higher need for data governance. Additionally, researchers at medical faculties as compared to other university faculties reported a more unsupportive supervisor with regards to open science practices and a higher need for data governance. The results suggest growing adoption of open science practices but also highlight a number of important impediments. © 2022",Data sharing; fMRI; Metascience; Neuroimaging; Open science; Preregistration; Replication; Reproducibility; Research methods; Robustness; Validity,NeuroImage,Article,2022,19,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119306

In particular, the extent to which one specializes within their chosen fields likely has complex relationships with productivity, career stage, and eventual impact. Here, we develop a novel and fine-grained approach for measuring a researcher’s level of specialization at each point in their career and apply it to the publication data of almost 30,000 established biomedical researchers to measure the effect that specialization has on the impact of a researcher’s publications. Results: Using a within-researcher, panel-based econometric framework, we arrive at several important results. First, there are significant scientific rewards for specialization—25% more citations per standard deviation increase in specialization. Second, these benefits are much higher early in a researcher’s career—as large as 75% per standard deviation increase in specialization. Third, rewards are higher for researchers who publish few papers relative to their peers. Finally, we find that, all else equal, researchers who make large changes in their research direction see generally increased impact. Conclusions: The extent to which one specializes, particularly at the early stages of a biomedical research career, appears to play a significant role in determining the citation-based impact of their publications. When this measure of impact is, implicitly or explicitly, an input into decision-making processes within the scientific system (for example, for job opportunities, promotions, or invited talks), these findings lead to some important implications for the system-level organization of scientific research and the incentives that exist therein. We propose several mechanisms within modern scientific systems that likely lead to the scientific rewards we observe and discuss them within the broader context of reward structures in biomedicine and science more generally. © 2022, The Author(s).",Bibliometrics; Research systems; Science of science; Scientific careers; Scientific impact; Scientific specialization,BMC Biology,Article,2022,0,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1186/s12915-022-01400-5

As scientists explore the world, and indeed the universe, more and more deeply, new demands are constantly made for innovations in scientific instruments. More advanced scientific instruments, in turn, promote greater advances in the underlying science. Although the relationship between developments in scientific instruments and advances in science is intuitive, it has not been estimated statistically. Gaining a better empirical understanding of this relationship is, therefore, important to the science of science. Previous studies have not revealed whether there is a measurable interactive effect between them. To fill this gap in the research, we collected 42 years of data on the number of global scientific instrument patents and 42 years of data on the number of scientific research papers, both during the period 1980–2021. We take the logs of these counts (lnsi and lnsp) and perform time-series analyses of the two data sets. The Granger Causality Test is then employed to ascertain whether there exists an observable mutual association between the two time-series. The Granger Causality Test reveals, with a very high degree of confidence, a mutual predictive relationship between them. Stated differently, each time-series appears to “forecast” the other, with different time lags. A number of the Granger Causality Tests based on the characteristics of si/ sp disclose that the interaction between si and sp also applies to the mutual effect between the characteristics of si and sp, with different lag lengths. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Co-integration; Scientific Instruments; Scientific Publications; The Granger Causality Test; Time-series Analysis,Scientometrics,Article,2022,2,NA,English,10.1007/s11192-022-04516-1

Casting doubt on the accuracy of scientific work is not fruitful, especially when an individual researcher cannot reproduce the claims made in the paper. There could be many subjective reasons behind the inability to reproduce a scientific paper. The field of Machine Learning (ML) faces a reproducibility crisis, and surveying a portion of published articles has resulted in a group realization that although sharing code repositories would be appreciable, code bases are not the end all be all for determining the reproducibility of an article. Various parties involved in the publication process have come forward to address the reproducibility crisis and solutions such as badging articles as reproducible, reproducibility checklists at conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc.), and sharing artifacts on OpenReview come across as promising solutions to the core problem. The breadth of literature on reproducibility focuses on measures required to avoid ir-reproducibility, and there is not much research into the effort behind reproducing these articles. In this paper, we investigate the factors that contribute to the easiness and difficulty of reproducing previously published studies and report on the foundational framework to quantify effort of reproducibility.  © 2023 IEEE.",computational reproducibility; Effort of reproducibility; replicability; reproducibility; scholarly communication; science of science,Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries,Conference paper,2023,1,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1109/JCDL57899.2023.00018

The quality of a research field is greatly determined by the quality of its publications. However, in many research fields this quality is endangered because of biases towards publishing positive results, which have led to questionable research practices that negatively impact the reliability of the reported findings. Objectives. We explored two approaches that could guard against these questionable research practices for computer science education research: 1. The replication of prior studies to confirm (or refute) previous findings and 2. requiring authors to submit a registered report, containing hypotheses, methods, and analytic procedures, before conducting the studies. Method. Over the span of 18 months, we organized a special issue of the Computer Science Education journal that only accepted registered reports that replicated a previous computer science education research study. Registered reports involve peer review and approval at the research design stage, before data collection begins. The editorial process was thus modified to accommodate multiple rounds of review and a longer time period between original and final submissions. We believe this is the first use of registered reports in computer science education research. A questionnaire gathering feedback on the new process was also administered to the authors of the accepted reports. Findings. We found seven author teams willing to submit a manuscript for the special issue. Out of this pool, preregistered reports from five teams were accepted to be taken forwards. One team then withdrew because the ethics procedure at their institution exceeded the special issue timeline. The remaining four author teams conducted their studies and resubmitted full papers that were accepted, pending some final corrections. Authors' feedback about the registered reports process was positive. Implications. We demonstrated that it is possible to attract interest for registered report replications in a computer science education journal issue, and to successfully conduct the necessary editorial steps. Future efforts should attend to challenges related to modified research and journal submission timelines and consider adding a second review cycle for the first stage of registered reports. While the procedures used in this special issue may be suitable for many research approaches, further discussion is warranted on how they can be combined with exploratory research (as opposed to hypothesis testing research) and how they can be adapted to non-positivist research.  © 2022 ACM.",Metascience; Preregistration; Registered Reports; Replication,ICER 2022 - Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research,Conference paper,2022,5,NA,English,10.1145/3501385.3543971

Yet, these types of statements contain very different information and implications. This randomized controlled trial sought to characterize the granular effects of using normative language in science communication. Objective: Our study examined whether viewing a social media post containing scientific claims about face masks for COVID-19 using both normative and cognitive language (intervention arm) would reduce perceptions of trust and credibility in science and scientists compared with an identical post using only cognitive language (control arm). We also examined whether effects were mediated by political orientation. Methods: This was a 2-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. We aimed to recruit 1500 US adults (age 18+) from the Prolific platform who were representative of the US population census by cross sections of age, race/ethnicity, and gender. Participants were randomly assigned to view 1 of 2 images of a social media post about face masks to prevent COVID-19. The control image described the results of a real study (cognitive language), and the intervention image was identical, but also included recommendations from the same study about what people should do based on the results (normative language). Primary outcomes were trust in science and scientists (21-item scale) and 4 individual items related to trust and credibility; 9 additional covariates (eg, sociodemographics, political orientation) were measured and included in analyses. Results: From September 4, 2022, to September 6, 2022, 1526 individuals completed the study. For the sample as a whole (eg, without interaction terms), there was no evidence that a single exposure to normative language affected perceptions of trust or credibility in science or scientists. When including the interaction term (study arm × political orientation), there was some evidence of differential effects, such that individuals with liberal political orientation were more likely to trust scientific information from the social media post's author if the post included normative language, and political conservatives were more likely to trust scientific information from the post's author if the post included only cognitive language (β=0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.10; P=.04). Conclusions: This study does not support the authors' original hypotheses that single exposures to normative language can reduce perceptions of trust or credibility in science or scientists for all people. However, the secondary preregistered analyses indicate the possibility that political orientation may differentially mediate the effect of normative and cognitive language from scientists on people's perceptions. We do not submit this paper as definitive evidence thereof but do believe that there is sufficient evidence to support additional research into this topic, which may have implications for effective scientific communication. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

As a set of fictional representations of technologically driven future worlds, the Metaverse is increasingly shaping the socio-technical imaginaries of data-driven smart cities, i.e., the outcome of radical transformations of dominant structures, processes, practices, and cultures. At the core of the systematic exploration of science and technology is the relationships between scientific knowledge, technological systems, and values and ethics from a wide range of perspectives. Positioned within science of science, this study investigates the complex interplay between the Metaverse as a form of science and technology and the wider social context in which it is embedded. Therefore, it adopts an analytical and philosophical framework of STS, and in doing so, it employs an integrated approach to discourse analysis, supported by a comparative analysis of the Metaverse and Ambient Intelligence. This study shows that the Metaverse as a scientific and technological activity is socially constructed, politically driven, economically conditioned, and historically situated. That is, it is inherently human and hence value-laden, as well as can only be understood as contextualized within the socio-political-economic-historical framework that gives rise to it, sustains it, and makes it durable by material effects and networks. This view in turn corroborates that the Metaverse raises serious concerns as to determinism, social exclusion, marginalization, privacy erosion, surveillance, control, democratic backsliding, hive mentality, cyber-utopianism, and dystopianism. This study argues that, due to the problematic nature of the Metaverse in terms of its inherent ethical and social implications, there need to be more explicit processes and practices for enhancing public participation and allowing a more democratic public role in its shaping and control, especially early in the decision-making process of its development—when the opportunity for effective inputs and informed choices is greatest. The novelty of this study lies in that it is the first of its kind with respect to probing the link between the Metaverse and data-driven smart cities from an STS perspective. The main contribution of this study lies in deepening and extending social scientific critiques and understandings of the imaginaries of data-driven smart cities based on the analysis and evaluation of the Metaverse and the warning signals and troubling visions it conveys and animates in order to help construct desirable alternative futures for the greater good of all citizens. The ultimate goal is to structure the Metaverse in ways that are morally acceptable and collectively the most democratically beneficial for society. © 2022 by the author.",data-driven smart cities; democracy; dystopia; fictional representations; Metaverse; privacy; science and technology; society; socio-technical imaginaries; surveillance; utopia,Smart Cities,Article,2022,117,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.3390/smartcities5030043

Here, we aimed to add to this body of work by exploring academic psychologists’ perceptions of the state of the field using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. As part of a larger project, psychological researchers (N = 548) used 3-point scales to rate their perceptions of: 1) the rate of false positive findings in psychology and 2) the quality of research practices in psychology. They then wrote about the reasons for their ratings. Using a qualitative approach, we assessed the prevalence of criticisms and defenses of the field, as well as subtypes of each. Overall, these data shed light on the extent, and nature, of concerns about false positives and research practices within the psychological community. © 2022 Massachussetts Medical Society.

There are no verified regulations for the empirical, theoretical and contextual substantiation of conclusions and methods for obtaining them; the voices of the theoreticians of pedagogical science about the structure and component composition of pedagogical theory sound polyphonic. The differences between theory and concept, long recognized in the science of science, do not find the right understanding and response in pedagogical works. Pedagogy, being an integral member of the community of human sciences, must today enter into an active and meaningful scientific dialogue with methodologists, science scholars, humanists, who represent a “strong” version of human knowledge. Described by the famous Russian philosopher L.A. Mikeshina’s methodological dialogues prompted us to take up the urgently required concretization of the author’s interesting conclusions and arguments in relation to the methodology of pedagogy which L.A. Mikeshina presents as transfer of terms (extrapolation). Based on the analysis of the cited book and many works of philosophers and teachers, we managed to build a triad of criteria for correct extrapolation of terms: a) address correctness; correspondence of the pedagogical sound of the term transferred to pedagogy to that which is accepted in donor science; b) the creative focus of the transferred term; c) detachment from repetition of the well-known method of noise stylistic reproduction. As one of the examples of the transfer of knowledge into pedagogy, the author considers the absorption by the science of education of the stylistics of related sciences based on scientific metaphors. The second part of the article is devoted to the theoretical construction of pedagogy. A methodological screen of a particular pedagogical theory is presented, white spots of the topic are revealed, the idea of theoretical constructions in pedagogy, reflected qualitatively and quantitatively, is proposed. The connection between the problem of knowledge transfer (1) and the theoretical construction of pedagogy (2) is shown. © The Authors.",criteria for the correctness of transfer of knowledge; glossary of pedagogy; pedagogical theory; theoretical construction of pedagogy; transfer of knowledge (according to L.A.

It consists of a well-characterized research synthesis design that is used to address a systematically posed research question and a pertinent bibliome employing validated instruments to produce quantitative data for acceptability and overall statistical analyses. The outcome of the systematic review synthesis of the research literature in that manner yields a consensus of the best available evidence, which is then judiciously—that is, free of biases and fallacies—incorporated in the clinical decision-making. In brief, metascience in dentistry and medicine consists of two primary domains: evidence-based research, the generation of the best available evidence through systematic review synthesis of the research; and evidence-based clinical decision-making, the incorporation of the best available evidence with the clinician's training expertise and judgment into the most beneficial treatment intervention for any given patient. Metascience in healthcare is patient-centered, effectiveness-focused, and evidence-based because of the nature of how the original evidence-based research question is generated at the onset of the research synthesis design and at the conclusion of the process the clinician is incorporating the best available evidence in the formulation of the optimal treatment protocol for that patient. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022, corrected publication 2022.",Best available evidence; Bibliome; Comparative effectiveness research; CONSORT; Evidence-based clinical decision-making; Meta-analysis; Metascience; PRISMA; Research synthesis; Risk of bias; Stakeholders; Systematic review,Dental Sleep Medicine: A Clinical Guide,Book chapter,2022,0,NA,English,10.1007/978-3-031-10646-0_1

Objective: This study addresses the enhancement of the Rigor and Transparency Index (RTI, version 2.0), which attempts to automatically assess the rigor and transparency of journals, institutions, and countries using manuscripts scored on criteria found in reproducibility guidelines (eg, Materials Design, Analysis, and Reporting checklist criteria). Methods: The RTI tracks 27 entity types using natural language processing techniques such as Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Conditional Random Field-based models and regular expressions; this allowed us to assess over 2 million papers accessed through PubMed Central. Results: Between 1997 and 2020 (where data were readily available in our data set), rigor and transparency measures showed general improvement (RTI 2.29 to 4.13), suggesting that authors are taking the need for improved reporting seriously. The top-scoring journals in 2020 were the Journal of Neurochemistry (6.23), British Journal of Pharmacology (6.07), and Nature Neuroscience (5.93). We extracted the institution and country of origin from the author affiliations to expand our analysis beyond journals. Among institutions publishing >1000 papers in 2020 (in the PubMed Central open access set), Capital Medical University (4.75), Yonsei University (4.58), and University of Copenhagen (4.53) were the top performers in terms of RTI. In country-level performance, we found that Ethiopia and Norway consistently topped the RTI charts of countries with 100 or more papers per year. In addition, we tested our assumption that the RTI may serve as a reliable proxy for scientific replicability (ie, a high RTI represents papers containing sufficient information for replication efforts). Using work by the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, we determined that replication papers (RTI 7.61, SD 0.78) scored significantly higher (P < .001) than the original papers (RTI 3.39, SD 1.12), which according to the project required additional information from authors to begin replication efforts. Conclusions: These results align with our view that RTI may serve as a reliable proxy for scientific replicability. Unfortunately, RTI measures for journals, institutions, and countries fall short of the replicated paper average. If we consider the RTI of these replication studies as a target for future manuscripts, more work will be needed to ensure that the average manuscript contains sufficient information for replication attempts. © Joe Menke, Peter Eckmann, Ibrahim Burak Ozyurt, Martijn Roelandse, Nathan Anderson, Jeffrey Grethe, Anthony Gamst, Anita Bandrowski.",cell line authentication; data and code availability; reporting transparency; reproducibility crisis; research metric; research reproducibility; rigor and transparency; science of science; university ranking,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Article,2022,14,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.2196/37324

This article investigates which broad academic fields use questionnaires, whether this use is increasing, and whether it generates average citation impact. This is investigated through a nonprobability sample: articles mentioning questionnaires in their titles, abstracts, or keywords. This procedure captures a minority of research using questionnaires, with substantial biases against fields using alternative terminology, such as ‘instrument’ or ‘survey’, or that rarely explicitly mention questionnaires in titles, abstract or keywords because they play a minor role. The results suggest that the proportion of journal articles using questionnaires tripled between 1996 and 2019, and this proportion increased in all 27 broad Scopus fields. Over the same period, the citation impact of the identified research declined from above average to below average. Thus, whilst academic research seems to be increasingly using questionnaires, the quality or scholarly value of research using questionnaires may be declining. These are tentative conclusions because of the unknown sampling bias for the set of questionnaire-based articles analysed. © 2021 The Authors.

Hence, a problem arises: whether we will apply the principle of empiricism to justification of metascientific reasonings (in particular, to sociological explanations of knowing actions of scientists). This, in turn, leads to a problem of universality of philosophy as a platform for metascientific criticism. The formulation and the solution of such a problem assume the possibility of creation of metaphilosophical systems radicalizing the principle of reflexivity before its application to philosophy. Thereby the philosophy of science appears in the field of immanent paradoxes. An exit from similar paradoxes demands new prospect of philosophical researches. © 2022 RAS Institute of Philosophy.

One strategy to maximize replication quality is involving the original authors in study design. We (N = 17 Labs and N = 1,550 participants, after exclusions) experimentally tested whether original author involvement improved replicability of a classic finding from Terror Management Theory (Greenberg et al., 1994). Our results were non-diagnostic of whether original author involvement improves replicability because we were unable to replicate the finding under any conditions. This suggests that the original finding was either a false positive or the conditions necessary to obtain it are not fully understood or no longer exist.

The science of science approach used here provides high-level insight into how the dynamics of dominance hierarchy research have shifted over this long timescale. To summarize these patterns, I extracted publication metadata using a Google Scholar search for the phrase 'dominance hierarchy', resulting in over 26 000 publications. I used text mining approaches to assess patterns in three areas: (1) general patterns in publication frequency and rate, (2) dynamics of term usage and (3) term co-occurrence in publications across the history of the field. While the overall number of publications per decade continues to rise, the percent growth rate has fallen in recent years, demonstrating that although there is sustained interest in dominance hierarchies, the field is no longer experiencing the explosive growth it showed in earlier decades. Results from title term co-occurrence networks and community structure show that the different subfields of dominance hierarchy research were most strongly separated early in the field's history while modern research shows more evidence for cohesion and a lack of distinct term community boundaries. These methods provide a general view of the history of research on dominance hierarchies and can be applied to other fields or search terms to gain broad synthetic insight into patterns of interest, especially in fields with large bodies of literature.

In this respect, this text can also be treated as a gloss to the contemporary dispute about the university and a reminder that this dispute should also be a reference point for the theory of social knowledge, taking into account the different contexts of interactions and their institutional complexity in which scientific facts (and most cognitive acts) are made. © 2022 Korean Society for Food Engineering.

Yet, there is very little oversight to ensure the completeness and reusability of archived datasets, and we currently have a poor understanding of the factors associated with high-quality data sharing. We assessed 362 open datasets linked to first-or senior-Authored papers published by 100 principal investigators (PIs) in the fields of ecology and evolution over a period of 7 years to identify predictors of data completeness and reusability (data archiving quality). Datasets scored low on these metrics: 56.4% were complete and 45.9% were reusable. Data reusability, but not completeness, was slightly higher for more recently archived datasets and PIs with less seniority. Journal open data policy, PI gender and PI corresponding author status were unrelated to data archiving quality. However, PI identity explained a large proportion of the variance in data completeness (27.8%) and reusability (22.0%), indicating consistent interindividual differences in data sharing practices by PIs across time and contexts. Several PIs consistently shared data of either high or low archiving quality, but most PIs were inconsistent in how well they shared. One explanation for the high intra-individual variation we observed is that PIs often conduct research through students and postdoctoral researchers, who may be responsible for the data collection, curation and archiving. Levels of data literacy vary among trainees and PIs may not regularly perform quality control over archived files.

Some popular theories of consciousness have been described as unfalsifiable and some as “overpromoted”. To objectively evaluate the state of consciousness science as a field, we analyzed bibliometric data for five major theories of consciousness: Global workspace (GWT), Higher-order (HOT), Integrated information (IIT), Local recurrent (LRT), and Quantum theories (QT). We analyzed academic publications, citations, and Twitter activity for each theory. We found that IIT had the highest growth rates in quantity metrics (e.g. publication and citation counts) but was worse in quality metrics (e.g., per-publication citations, proportion of citations with empirical support/contradiction). On social media, IIT and QT were the most-tweeted theories, but their tweets mostly came from the general public. Our findings suggest that a theory's fast growth in quantity and lack of quality could be explained by its overpromotion on social media. © 2022",Bibliometrics; Consciousness; Consciousness theories; Metascience; Social media,Consciousness and Cognition,Article,2022,4,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.concog.2022.103296

Why Human-Robot Interaction User Studies May Have Replicability Problems and Directions for Improvement,"There is a confidence crisis in many scientific disciplines, in particular disciplines researching human behavior, as many effects of original experiments have not been replicated successfully in large-scale replication studies. While human-robot interaction (HRI) is an interdisciplinary research field, the study of human behavior, cognition and emotion in HRI plays also a vital part. Are HRI user studies facing the same problems as other fields and if so, what can be done to overcome them? In this article, we first give a short overview of the replicability crisis in behavioral sciences and its causes. In a second step, we estimate the replicability of HRI user studies mainly 1) by structural comparison of HRI research processes and practices with those of other disciplines with replicability issues, 2) by systematically reviewing meta-analyses of HRI user studies to identify parameters that are known to affect replicability, and 3) by summarizing first replication studies in HRI as direct evidence. Our findings suggest that HRI user studies often exhibit the same problems that caused the replicability crisis in many behavioral sciences, such as small sample sizes, lack of theory, or missing information in reported data. In order to improve the stability of future HRI research, we propose some statistical, methodological and social reforms. This article aims to provide a basis for further discussion and a potential outline for improvements in the field.

In this perspective piece, we link metrics to mechanisms by demonstrating how emerging metrics of science not only offer complementaries to existing ones, but also shed light on the hidden structure and mechanisms of science. Based on fundamental properties of science, we classify existing theories and findings into: hot and cold science referring to attention shift between scientific fields, fast and slow science reflecting productivity of scientists and teams, soft and hard science revealing reproducibility of scientific research. We suggest that interest about mechanisms of science since Derek J. de Solla Price, Robert K.

With the use of social media now entrenched among researchers, there are important questions about the role of ad hominems. Ad hominems and other forms of strong criticism became particularly evident in online discussions associated with the recent replication crisis in psychology. Here, these discussions, and a few incidences of ad hominems in journal articles, are situated in the broader history of science.

To this end, we surveyed 355 researchers, 299 of whom had used preregistration in their own work. The researchers indicated the experienced or expected effects of preregistration on their workflow. The results show that experiences and expectations are mostly positive. Researchers in our sample believe that implementing preregistration improves or is likely to improve the quality of their projects.

Only few scientific milestones remain relevant and continuously attract citations. Here we quantify how long scientific work remains being utilized, how long it takes before today's work is forgotten, and how milestone papers differ from those forgotten. To answer these questions, we study the complete temporal citation network of all American Physical Society journals. We quantify the probability of attracting citations for individual publications based on age and the number of citations they have received in the past. We capture both aspects, the forgetting and the tendency to cite already popular works, in a microscopic generative model for the dynamics of scientific citation networks. We find that the probability of citing a specific paper declines with age as a power law with an exponent of α ∼-1.4. Whenever a paper in its early years can be characterized by a scaling exponent above a critical value, α c, the paper is likely to become 'ever-lasting'. We validate the model with out-of-sample predictions, with an accuracy of up to 90% (area under the curve ∼0.9). The model also allows us to estimate an expected citation landscape of the future, predicting that 95% of papers cited in 2050 have yet to be published. The exponential growth of articles, combined with a power-law type of forgetting and papers receiving fewer and fewer citations on average, suggests a worrying tendency toward information overload and raises concerns about scientific publishing's long-term sustainability.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Thus, this study maps the evolution of SME research in tourism and hospitality. Methods: The study adopts a bibliometric protocol to carry out the desired analysis. The literature is retrieved from the Scopus database using the desired search string and analysis is conducted on 385 documents. The study uses VOSviewer, the Science of Science tool, Gephi, and Inkscape to carry out the bibliometric and network analysis. Results: The results from network analysis helps in the identification of five major thematic areas such as strengthening SMEs' performance, transformational leadership, building SME resilience, entrepreneurship and sustainability, and building competitiveness in SMEs. The dynamic co-citation analysis helps in identifying the evolution of these themes. The content analysis of the literature provides future research direction and the need for methodological advancement in SMEs' performance and growth. Implications: The study offers implications for future researchers by summarising the literature, identifying the gaps and suggesting future directions of the research. The study limits itself to data retrieval from a single database. © 2022 International Hellenic University.",bibliometrics; competitiveness; innovation; resilience; SMEs; tourism,"Journal of Tourism, Heritage and Services Marketing",Article,2022,6,NA,English,10.5281/zenodo.7358571

Robin L.,7003278670,"Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University, Canberra, 0200, ACT, Australia",Soil in the air,"The post-war era of the 1940s is known for the birth of global governance, a time when Western nations united in efforts to reconstruct the war-torn world and reflected on the role of science in society. History and philosophy of science (HPS) was one of the early projects that emerged out of the war years. Diana (Ding) Dyason who headed the first HPS department in the southern hemisphere is honoured by this annual lecture, the text of which constitutes this article. Thomas Kuhn's influential lecture in Oxford in 1961 inspired her work on the history of scientific entanglement with social concerns, and the directions of HPS at the University of Melbourne. Post-war reconstruction was both a local and a national project for every nation, very much in the air in the 1940s, and influential until the 1970s. The Australasian Association of Scientific Workers (AASW) brought together scientists too old to serve, or, in reserved occupations, to undertake their own 'war effort' on the question of: 'What comes next?' AASW held a planning conference in Sydney in 1944 to 'formulate a policy on the organisation of science necessary to meet the demands of post-war Australia'. They set out to consider the role of the 'the scientific method' in the welfare of society. In particular, they recognised their existing international scientific networks and connections could become valuable for post-war collaborations between different sciences and different nations of benefit to Australia and the world. The idea of 'the environment' was one of many that emerged internationally in these 'world-minded' times, an idea that focused on the management of nature for the benefit of people using the scientific method. National Parks were a crucial discussion point, bringing together amateur naturalists and professional environmental managers of all sorts in discussions about landscape planning along with international comparative work on reserving places for wild animals and plants. This Dyason Lecture explores the emergence of 'integrated science', of science in the service of society, that later included natural resource management, big science, environmental science, earth systems science and climate science. It begins with the tragedy of the 'dirty thirties', when soil was in the air, and the scientific response to concerns about feeding the world. © 2022 CSIRO.

In this article, we call on psychological scientists—focusing specifically on those who use quantitative methods in the United States as one context for such conversations—to begin reimagining our discipline as fundamentally open and inclusive. First, we discuss whom our discipline was designed to serve and how this history produced the inequitable reward and support systems we see today. Second, we highlight how current institutional responses to address worsening inequalities are inadequate, as well as how our disciplinary perspective may both help and hinder our ability to craft effective solutions. Third, we take a hard look in the mirror at the disconnect between what we ostensibly value as a field and what we actually practice.

They identify the culprit as the many degrees of freedom that allows researchers to design experiments more likely to support their theory, to explain away contradictory findings using auxiliary hypotheses, and to avoid conducting strong tests of their theory relative to others. They argue that adversarial collaboration can resolve issues by pitting competing theories against each other directly until one comes out victorious or modified.

How people appraise their own goals on various quantitative dimensions, like commitment or difficulty, predicts important outcomes like goal attainment and psychological well-being. Unfortunately, however, there appears to be little agreement in the literature on how to best measure goal dimensions. To get an overview of current measurement practices, we conducted a systematic literature review that yielded 693 publications including 1,166 different terms for goal dimensions and 3,244 reported items. Up to 79 different items were found to indicate single goal dimensions and 80% of scales consisted of one item, which mostly asked for the term of the goal dimension name. We further extracted 358 different item facets, that is, different meaning- bearing terms (e.g., “engrossed” or “deeply involved”). Of these item facets, 28% were found only once in individual items, and 52% were used to measure more than one goal dimension. We found that for 42% of items, sources were not reported, or items were created ad hoc. Hence, we recommend being cautious of jingle fallacies when comparing similar goal dimensions across publications and being cautious of jangle fallacies when comparing different goal dimensions. We advocate considering construct validity and content validity more thoroughly in the development of goal dimension items and enhancing transparency in reporting of study items. Furthermore, we advocate factor analysis methodology to narrow down the abundance of goal dimension terms and developing parsimonious and comprehensive theories of goal dimensions. © 2022 American Psychological Association",Goal dimensions; Goals; Jingle and jangle fallacies; Meta-science; Questionable measurement practices,Motivation Science,Article,2022,6,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1037/mot0000268

We then present an analysis of 3384 papers from the field of psycholinguistics that we coded based upon whether a clear description of contrast coding was present.

Between 2018 and 2019, the journal Gait & Posture introduced a requirement for sample size justification in their author guidelines. Research Question: How frequently and in what ways are sample sizes justified in Gait & Posture research articles and was the inclusion of a guideline requiring sample size justification associated with a change in practice? Methods: The guideline was not in place prior to May 2018 and was in place from 25th July 2019. All articles in the three most recent volumes of the journal (84−86) and the three most recent, pre-guideline volumes (60−62) at time of preregistration were included in this analysis. This provided an initial sample of 324 articles (176 pre-guideline and 148 post-guideline). Articles were screened by two authors to extract author data, article metadata and sample size justification data. Specifically, screeners identified if (yes or no) and how sample sizes were justified. Six potential justification types (Measure Entire Population, Resource Constraints, Accuracy, A priori Power Analysis, Heuristics, No Justification) and an additional option of Other/Unsure/Unclear were used. Results: In most cases, authors of Gait & Posture articles did not provide a justification for their study's sample size. The inclusion of the guideline was associated with a modest increase in the percentage of articles providing a justification (16.6–28.1%). A priori power calculations were the dominant type of justification, but many were not reported in enough detail to allow replication. Significance: Gait & Posture researchers should be more transparent in how they determine their sample sizes and carefully consider if they are suitable. Editors and journals may consider adding a similar guideline as a low-resource way to improve sample size justification reporting. © 2021 The Authors",Metascience; Power analysis; Resources; Statistical power; Study design,Gait and Posture,Article,2022,12,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2021.12.010

Here, we develop a discipline-independent method to identify the giant for any individual paper, allowing us to better understand the role and characteristics of giants in science. We find that across disciplines, about 95% of papers appear to stand on the shoulders of giants, yet the weight of scientific progress rests on relatively few shoulders. Defining a new measure of giant index, we find that, while papers with high citations are more likely to be giants, for papers with the same citations, their giant index sharply predicts a paper’s future impact and prize-winning probabilities. Giants tend to originate from both small and large teams, being either highly disruptive or highly developmental. Papers that did not have a giant tend to do poorly on average, yet interestingly, if such papers later became a giant for other papers, they tend to be home-run papers that are highly disruptive to science. Given the crucial importance of citation-based measures in science, the developed concept of giants may offer a useful dimension in assessing scientific impact that goes beyond sheer citation counts. © 2022 Woo Seong Jo, Lu Liu, and Dashun Wang.",citation network; cocitation; science of science; scientific impact,Quantitative Science Studies,Article,2022,8,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1162/qss_a_00186

Inference methods on scientific KGs can be confounded by unspecified contexts and contradictions. Extracting context enables incorporation of relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic detail, such as tissue specificity of interactions.

On many current issues (GMO crops, vaccinations, climate change) sectors of the public hold views differing from those of most scientists, and they often do not support proposals based on the scientists’ views. The overall cultural authority of science has also been challenged in the last decade by several negative trends in the sciences themselves, including widely-reported cases of fraud and failures in replication. With the support of professional science organizations, science communication specialists have stepped in aggressively to address science’s communication problems scientifically. This paper will examine the assumptions behind their advice on scientific information, their recommended strategies of framing, narration, and projecting trustworthiness, and their characterizations of audiences and the nature of science itself. From the perspective of rhetorical argumentation, the science communication literature does not promote addressing audiences as citizens capable of rational argumentation.

The usual processes that supposedly provide mechanisms for scientific self-correction, such as journal-based peer review and institutional committees, have been inadequate. We describe more verifiable indicators of a field’s commitment to self-correction. These fall under the broad headings of 1) transparency, which is already the subject of many reform efforts and 2) critical appraisal, which has received less attention and which we focus on here. Only by obtaining Observable Self-Correction Indicators (OSCIs) can we begin to evaluate the claim that “science is self-correcting.” We expect that the veracity of this claim varies across fields and subfields, and suggest that some fields, such as psychology and biomedicine, fall far short of an appropriate level of transparency and, especially, critical appraisal. Fields without robust, verifiable mechanisms for transparency and critical appraisal cannot reasonably be said to be self-correcting, and thus do not warrant the credibility often imputed to science as a whole. © The Author(s) 2021.",epistemology; history of psychology; metascience; replication,Review of General Psychology,Article,2022,31,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1177/10892680211033912

Although this heterogeneity is an inherent part of science (e.g., sampling variability; studying different conditions), not all heterogeneity results from unavoidable sources. In particular, the flexibility researchers have when designing studies and analyzing data adds additional heterogeneity. This flexibility has been the topic of considerable discussion in the last decade. Ideas, and corresponding phrases, have been introduced to help unpack researcher behaviors, including researcher degrees of freedom and questionable research practices. Using these concepts and phrases, methodological and substantive researchers have considered how researchers’ choices impact statistical conclusions and reduce clarity in the research literature. While progress has been made, inconsistent, vague, and overlapping use of the terminology surrounding these choices has made it difficult to have clear conversations about the most pressing issues. Further refinement of the language conveying the underlying concepts can catalyze further progress. We propose a revised, expanded taxonomy for assessing research and reporting practices. In addition, we redefine several crucial terms in a way that reduces overlap and enhances conceptual clarity, with particular focus on distinguishing practices along two lines: research versus reporting practices and choices involving multiple empirically supported options versus choices known to be subpar. We illustrate the effectiveness of these changes using conceptual and simulated demonstrations, and we discuss how this taxonomy can be valuable to substantive researchers by helping to navigate this flexibility and to methodological researchers by motivating research toward areas of greatest need. © 2022 American Psychological Association",heterogeneity; metascience; questionable research practices; replication; researcher degrees of freedom,Psychological Methods,Article,2022,6,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1037/met0000488

In this article, we examine central metascientific premises and argue that attempts to solve the replication crisis in psychology will benefit from a tighter integration of approaches from the psychological humanities. The first part of our article identifies central epistemic merits that metascientific endeavors can contribute to psychology. However, we argue secondly against the widespread claim that metascience is the only way to deal with the replication crisis in psychology and point to major epistemic problems: the one-sided notion of a singular scientific method, the homogenizing view of psychology, and the exclusion of practices of theorizing. As a possible compensation for such shortcomings, we introduce, third, the reflective and pluralistic approach of psychological humanities. In so doing, we show how psychological humanities can serve as an important complement to the objective of improving psychological research. Psychological humanities contribute to a more precise determination of validity, to ethical considerations, and a better understanding of psychology’s objects in regard to replication. Accordingly, we argue for the integration of psychological humanities into both metascience and psychology to provide a better basis for addressing epistemic and ethical questions. © The Author(s) 2022.","history of psychology; metascience; psychological humanities; replication; reproducibility; theoretical psychology; validity, ethics in psychology",Review of General Psychology,Article,2022,16,NA,English,10.1177/10892680221083876

The goal of this systematic review is to evaluate the quality of the research on physical activity (PA) behavior change and its potential to contribute to policy-making processes in the early days of COVID-19 related restrictions. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of methodological quality of current research according to PRISMA guidelines using Pubmed and Web of Science, of articles on PA behavior change that were published within 365 days after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Items from the JBI checklist and the AXIS tool were used for additional risk of bias assessment. Evidence mapping is used for better visualization of the main results. Conclusions about the significance of published articles are based on hypotheses on PA behavior change in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Among the 1,903 identified articles, there were 36% opinion pieces, 53% empirical studies, and 9% reviews. Of the 332 studies included in the systematic review, 213 used self-report measures to recollect prepandemic behavior in often small convenience samples. Most focused changes in PA volume, whereas changes in PA types were rarely measured. The majority had methodological reporting flaws. Few had very large samples with objective measures using repeated measure design (pre and during the pandemic). In addition to the expected decline in PA duration, these studies show that many of those who were active prepandemic, continued to be active during the pandemic. Conclusions: Research responded quickly at the onset of the pandemic. However, most of the studies lacked robust methodology, and PA behavior change data lacked the accuracy needed to guide policy makers. To improve the field, we propose the implementation of longitudinal cohort studies by larger organizations such as WHO to ease access to data on PA behavior, and suggest those institutions set clear standards for this research. Researchers need to ensure a better fit between the measurement method and the construct being measured, and use both objective and subjective measures where appropriate to complement each other and provide a comprehensive picture of PA behavior.

The study of the global pool of theses and dissertations in disaster medicine can reflect the general structure of innovative research and will assist in reviewing current scientific literature in this field of knowledge. Intention is to analyze the structure and dynamics of the number of foreign dissertations in disaster medicine and compare them with similar indicators of Russian dissertations. Methodology. The object of study is the global pool of dissertations presented in the ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global electronic database, Health & Medicine section, for the period 1992–2020 and an array of domestic dissertations in the scientific specialty 05.26.02 “Safety in emergency situations” (medical, biological and psychological sciences) for 1992–2020. The quantitative indicators of foreign and Russian dissertations in emergency medicine were compared. Results and Discussion. The electronic search made it possible to find 28,423 foreign doctoral (PhD) dissertations in the problems of disaster medicine. The polynomial trend with a very high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.97) shows an increase in the annual number of dissertations for the period 1992–2020. The average annual number of dissertations in the period under review was 980 ± 386. Dissertations described general provisions (4.7 %), tasks and organization of the disaster medicine service (8.3 %), forecasting and modeling of the health consequences of emergencies (4.8 %), organization of medical-sanitary support (18.5 %), provision of medical care and treatment of victims (14.9 %), medical control, examination and rehabilitation of rescuers (2.3 %), training of disaster medicine specialists (12.8 %), biological issues (6.2 %), psychiatric and psychological security problems (28.1 %). The general array of dissertations was analyzed by leading countries and universities. Quantity and scope of foreign dissertations on the problems of disaster medicine were compared with those of Russian dissertations over time. Conclusion. More than 95 % of the analyzed pool of disaster medicine dissertations in the ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global database are published in full text.

The software tools for mapping knowledge domain (MKD) (VOSviewer and Science of Science (Sci2)) were used to analyze the performance of contributors and PFASs research topics, hotspots, and trends. Our results reveal that the number of PFASs-related articles published annually has increased significantly, with most originating from the United States (followed by those from China). The Chinese Academy of Sciences has published the most articles. A comprehensive analysis of title, keywords, and keywords plus showed that PFASs research hotspots include humans, precursors, and detection methods, with the main focuses being environmental science, toxicology, and environmental engineering. The four main research topics of PFASs were identified, and a literature review was carried out for each one. Overall, this study can supply researchers with a deeper understanding of the development of PFASs studies and provide a comprehensive data reference for researchers to further grasp the research direction in this field. © 2022",Bibliometrics; per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs); Review; Sci2; VOSviewer,Chemosphere,Review,2022,24,NA,English,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133853

However, a major hurdle is that the beneﬁts themselves are rather mixed: Quantitative evidence from psychology and behavioral sciences sometimes shows a positive epistemic effect of diversity, but often shows a null effect, or even a negative effect. Here we argue that to make progress with these why and how questions, we need ﬁrst to rethink when one ought to expect a beneﬁt of cognitive diversity. In doing so, we highlight that the beneﬁts of cognitive diversity are not equally distributed about collective intelligence tasks and are best seen for complex, multistage, creative problem solving, during problem posing and hypothesis generation.

These strategic priorities echo views widely shared within the HSPR community, and we commend IHSPR for its leadership and vision. Recognizing the systemic challenges ahead of us, this commentary considers the HSPR community's capacity to achieve the promise of learning health systems, given the obstacles likely to hinder their rapid scale-up over the next five years. Next, we consider the spread of virtual care during the pandemic to illustrate the embedded and negotiated nature of innovation in health systems and the need for vigilance as to the social distribution of their benefits and costs. Finally, a critical review of the strategic plan provides insights into how research is governed in the HSPR field. Based on this analysis, it appears essential to reconsider health system transformation as social system transformation and strengthen interdisciplinary and comparative research.

Intriguingly, experimenters currently lack an objective, generalizable, and continuous measure that precisely quantifies the incentives underlying these negotiation tasks. We present the conflict strength coefficient, which enables scholars to systematically quantify the incentive structures in these multi-issue negotiation tasks. By making the incentive structures accessible and numerically comparable, the conflict strength coefficient provides new insights into the central element of the experimental study of negotiation and conflict management, unmasks differences across existing tasks, facilitates research transparency, knowledge sharing, and open science practices. We demonstrate the coefficient’s benefits by providing a hands-on example from past research, by reviewing and quantitatively assessing the current literature, and by mapping conflict strength coefficients for the negotiation and conflict management research landscape and its subareas. Our analysis suggests that the conflict strength coefficient can enrich the understanding of cooperative and competitive incentives in the established tasks and directly guide and support an individual scholar’s process of knowledge creation.

This paper explores barriers and enablers to pre-registration, and develops an evidence-based behaviour change intervention specification to increase its uptake. The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework of intervention development and COM-B model of behaviour change were used to inform the development of a mixed-methods online questionnaire, assessing barriers and enablers to pre-registration. Data were collected from 18-05-2020 to 12-07-2020, and explored using descriptive statistics, reflexive thematic analysis, and COM-B. BCW was used to develop an intervention specification. Respondents were researchers (n = 105) who were mostly engaged in psychological research (71%) and had pre-registered before (75%). Insufficient knowledge and skill (psychological capability), social support (social opportunity), time (physical opportunity), and incentivisation (reflective motivation) were the most substantial barriers to pre-registration, whereas belief in pre-registration contributing to desirable research outcomes (reflective motivation) was the most substantial enabler. These findings informed the development of an intervention specification to increase pre-registration uptake by researchers. This paper demonstrates the strong potential of BCW to facilitate open research practices. The identified barriers and enablers, intervention specification, and the behaviour change approach outlined, may be used to increase pre-registration uptake; for example, developing new or refining existing training and incentivisation interventions. This paper may inspire others to consider the strong potential of BCW to facilitate open research practices and so contribute to enhanced research outcomes. © 2022 The Author(s).

It is also less well understood how a narrowing use of literature would affect the circulation of ideas in the sciences. Here, I show that the utilization of scientific literature follows dual tendencies over time: while a larger proportion of literature is cited at least a few times, citations are also concentrated more at the top of the citation distribution. Parallel to the latter trend, a paper’s future importance increasingly depends on its past citation performance. A random network model shows that the citation concentration is directly related to the greater stability of citation performance. The presented evidence suggests that the growing heterogeneity of citation impact restricts the mobility of research articles that do not gain attention early on. While concentration grows from the beginning of the studied period in 1970, citation dispersion manifests itself significantly only from the mid-1990s, when the popularity of freshly published papers also increased. Most likely, advanced information technologies to disseminate papers are behind both of these latter trends.

Comparingwith a set of nonretracted control papers fromthe same journals with similar publication year, number of coauthors, and author impact, we show that retracted papers receive more attention after publication not only on social media but also, on heavily curated platforms, such as news outlets and knowledge repositories, amplifying the negative impact on the public.

To illuminate the extent of and explore reasons for this bifurcation, and OS’s potential impact on EM/D, we conducted three studies. Method and Results: In Study 1, we reviewed editorial/publishing policies and empirical articles appearing in four major EM/D journals on the incentives for and use of OS. Journals varied in OS-related policies; 32 of 823 empirical articles incorporated any OS practices. Study 2 was a national mixed-methods survey of EM/D scholars’ (N = 141) and journal editors’ (N = 16) views about and experiences with OS practices. Emerged themes included beliefs about the impact of OS on scientific quality, possible professional disadvantages for EM/D scholars, and concerns about the welfare of and ethical risks posed for communities of color.

In addition, other key positions have influenced some waves but not others. The ideas of the Stoics, which do not deal with science or the philosophy of science but rather a pragmatic philosophy of life, have influenced second wave cognitive therapies, while Buddhism, again obviously not a philosophy of science, has influenced some third wave therapies; and neither of these had any significant influence on first wave behavior therapy. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each of these views of science can perhaps shed light on important issues, such as improving the problem-solving progress of behavior therapy. We will argue that the evolutionary epistemology (a naturalized scientific approach to understanding knowledge) of the first wave has held up to criticism well over time, as has the second wave’s (possible) adoption of Bartley’s (The retreat to commitment. Open Court, London, 1984) pan-critical rationalism although there are legitimate questions of this wave’s fidelity to Bartley’s epistemology. However, the third wave’s embrace of a rather obscure philosopher, Stephen Pepper (World hypotheses: A study in evidence. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1942), is most concerning as it is so outside the critical dialogue in mainstream meta-science/philosophy of science. Once again, we believe that an increased understanding of distinct views of science and the scientific method followed by the three waves of behavior therapy improves future scientific progress more efficiently in part by identifying weaknesses that can be addressed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",NA,"Behavior Therapy: First, Second, and Third Waves",Book chapter,2022,1,NA,English,10.1007/978-3-031-11677-3_3

An investigation in the science of science,"The purpose of this study is to explore if elite scientists play a key role in the genesis of transformative research. As there exist different types of transformative research, this paper focuses on one type of work, i.e. under-cited influential work,referred to as “sparking” articles. A comparative study between the h-indices of authors citing Nobel Prize-winning papers of sparking type and those of authors citing ordinary ones is conducted, focusing on the first author and the corresponding author of each paper. The results show that the citers of the Top 1% or Top 10% Citations Sets in the sparking group have much higher h-indices than those in the ordinary group. These findings imply that elite scientists, operationalized as those with a high h-index in the corresponding fields, are more sensitive to sparking work and, as such play a pivotal role in the genesis of transformative research.

Both the first and second approaches are methodologically promising. The authors trace the relationship between megascience and genomic research, for example, in the technological basis of these areas of scientific research-the latest and rapidly developing technologies, the use of complex and expensive scientific complexes that allow for unique research of a high degree of complexity.

We conducted a meta-science study characterizing the reporting policies of neurosurgical journals and other related peer-reviewed publications. Methods: Journals were retrieved in 7 searches using Journal Citation Reports and Google Scholar. Characteristics, impact metrics, and submission policies were extracted. Results: Of 486 results, 54 journals were included, including 27 neurosurgical and 27 related topical journals. Thirty-eight (70.4%) adopted authorship guidelines and 20 (37.0%) disclosure standards of the International Council of Medical Journal Editors.

NA,NA,NA,Connotations of Interdisciplinarity from the Perspective of Paradigms: Towards “Paradigms” in Information Science Research and Practices; [跨学科研究的范式解析: 理解情报学术中的 “范式”],"[Purpose/ significance] Interdisciplinary studies are beneficial to resolve complicated natural, environmental, and societal issues by improving unidisciplinarity from both knowledge and organization sides. Yet, extant studies regarding interdisciplinarity tended to focus on measurements of interdisciplinarity; little has been known about the conceptual and theoretical sides of interdisciplinarity in Information Science. This paper understands the connotations of interdisciplinarity from the perspective of paradigms; this is to fill in the gap of the theoretical underpinning of interdisciplinarity in Information Science. [Method/ process] This paper summarizes different perspectives regarding concepts of interdisciplinarity, understands the process of paradigm shift from three different aspects, namely differentiation, assimilation, and disappearance of paradigms, and examines the characteristics of paradigms. We also define the concepts and connotations of interdisciplinarity and investigate interdisciplinarity from two distinct yet related perspectives: ①knowledge recombination and novelty, and ②construction and destruction of disciplines. [Result/ conclusion] From the perspective of knowledge recombination and novelty, interdisciplinary studies are typical reifications of paradigm differentiation, paradigm assimilation, and meta-paradigm. From the perspective of construction and destruction of disciplines, interdisciplinary studies are driven by “creative destructions” of existing science (disciplines) and by forming new scholarly consensuses. These inspire Information Science that whilst methods and rules may change over time, the doctrine of Information Science does not change, and that understanding paradigms helps move Information Science forward. © 2022 Information studies: Theory and Application.

Drawing on 89,575 self-reports of team member research activity underlying scientific publications, we show how individual activities cohere into broad roles of 1) leadership through the direction and presentation of research and 2) support through data collection, analysis, and discussion. The hidden hierarchy of a scientific team is characterized by its lead (or L) ratio of members playing leadership roles to total team size. The L ratio is validated through correlation with imputed contributions to the specific paper and to science as a whole, which we use to effectively extrapolate the L ratio for 16,397,750 papers where roles are not explicit. We find that, relative to flat, egalitarian teams, tall, hierarchical teams produce less novelty and more often develop existing ideas, increase productivity for those on top and decrease it for those beneath, and increase short-term citations but decrease long-term influence. These effects hold within person—the same person on the same-sized team produces science much more likely to disruptively innovate if they work on a flat, high-L-ratio team. These results suggest the critical role flat teams play for sustainable scientific advance and the training and advancement of scientists.

This question is increasingly important, with recent discussion of a “reproducibility crisis” affecting many fields. Such discussions are vital in forensic science, a discipline that has experienced severe scrutiny from both the media and large oversight bodies. In this paper, we make three contributions to this discussion. First, we bring together and compare several studies in which laypeople were asked about the reliability of forensic science practices. This review suggests that forensic practices do not enjoy uniformly high reliability ratings from the public and these ratings are not calibrated with the scientific consensus. We then review three empirically-tested ways that other fields are dealing with their own crises, all centred around transparency and openness. Finally, we make recommendations for how forensic science can leverage transparency and openness to improve and maintain its long-term credibility. As part of these recommendations, we find that empirical research supports the Houston Forensic Science Center's recent claims that it has improved its credibility through openness and transparency. © 2022 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences",Credibility; Forensic science; Houston Forensic Science Center; Metaresearch; Metascience; Open science,Science and Justice,Review,2022,9,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.scijus.2022.02.006

What can any researchers do to confirm that they did not engage in questionable research practices? The solution is surprisingly simple. It lies in the transparent distinction between a priori planned, confirmatory steps of data analysis and exploratory, additional steps. The line between the two can be drawn easily by adhering to the open science practices outlined in this chap ter, particularly the detailed preregistration of all measures, manipulations, hypoth eses, and planned analysis steps.

Moreover, these non-NPs articles were not only published in the same year and in the same research field as the NP ones but were also dealing with the same research topic (such articles are referred to as non-NP articles). The results suggest that the topic-related knowledge included in Nobel Prize winning work is higher than that in non-NPs, hence with lower interdisciplinarity than the latter. Our findings provide useful clues to better understand the characteristics of transformative research, here represented by key publications by Nobel Prize laureates in Physiology or Medicine, and their pattern of knowledge integration. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Diversity of references; Matching groups; Nobel Prize winning articles; Science of science; Transformative research; Unexpected characteristics,Scientometrics,Article,2022,7,NA,English,10.1007/s11192-022-04290-0

The Italian scientific production regarding the COVID-19 throughout the first months of the health emergency could help to understand the heft of female researchers in this unique period. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the gender gap in the scientific production on COVID-19 in Italy during the first months of the pandemic. Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted and, for each included study, first and last author's gender, type of study, number of co-authors, type of affiliation, journal's Impact Factor (IF) and specialization were extracted. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed. Results: 22.2% of the articles were signed by a woman as first author, 18.1% as last authors. Female authorship was less frequent than male authorship regardless of the type of study, number of co-authors, type of affiliation and field of specialization. Conclusion: This analysis reveal a low prevalence of studies with a female first or last author and suggests that the low share of female authors publishing on COVID-19 during the considered timespan is a transversal issue throughout the Italian medical field.

Data absenteeism—the absence or limits of data on groups experiencing social vulnerability—is endemic; and as a result, inferences drawn from studies with absentee data are questionable. Reasons for data absenteeism include tendencies toward conventional recruitment of the subjects in research, the ways in which communities are engaged or not engaged in the research process, and a lack of understanding and appreciation of the lived reality of the socially vulnerable. The “hardly reached” are often labelled “hard to reach,” keeping this critical population out of view. One approach to mitigate data absenteeism is to engage key stakeholders of the community and its residents in the entire research process from design to dissemination, which influences how research questions are asked and answered and how research gets used. We argue for a more inclusive science of science communication to promote diversity and equity. © 2022 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.",communication inequlity; data absentism; measurement; science communication,Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,Article,2022,12,NA,English,10.1177/00027162221093268

However, in an era where the international economic climate has led to budget cuts, policymakers increasingly are looking to justify the returns from public investments, including in science and innovation. The so-called ‘impact agenda’ which has emerged in many countries around the world is part of this response; an attempt to understand and articulate for the public what benefits arise from the research that is funded. The United Kingdom is the most progressed in implementing this agenda and in 2014 the national research assessment exercise, the Research Excellence Framework, for the first time included the assessment of research impact as a component. For the first time within a dual funding system, funding would be awarded not only on the basis of the academic quality of research, but also on the wider impacts of that research. In this paper we outline the context and approach taken by the UK government, along with some of the core challenges that exist in implementing such an exercise.

In this paper, I therefore advocate for more theorizing in research on peer review. I first describe the main characteristics of the peer review literature, which focuses mainly on journal and grant peer review. Based on these characteristics, I then argue why theory is useful in research on peer review, and I present some theoretical efforts on peer review. I conclude by encouraging peer review researchers to be more theoretically engaged and outline activities that theoretical work on peer review could involve. This invitation to theory-building complements recent roadmaps and calls that have emphasized that we need to have better access to peer review data, improve research design and statistical analysis in peer review studies, experiment with innovative approaches to peer review, and provide more funding for peer review research. © 2022 Sven E.

This freedom may promote creativity in designing laboratory paradigms that shed light on real-world phenomena, but it also enables questionable research practices that undercut our collective credibility. Open Science norms impose some discipline but cannot constrain cherry-picking operational definitions that insulate preferred theories from rejection. All too often scholars conduct performative research to score points instead of engaging each other’s strongest arguments—a pattern that allows contradictory claims to fester unresolved for decades. Adversarial collaborations, which call on disputants to codevelop tests of competing hypotheses, are an efficient method of improving our science’s capacity for self-correction and of promoting intellectual competition that exposes false claims.

Psychological concepts (e.g., intelligence, attention) are easily assumed to represent objective, definable categories with an underlying essence. Like the “vital forces” previously thought to animate life, these assumed essences can create an illusion of understanding. By synthesizing a wide range of research lines from cognitive, clinical, and biological psychology and neuroscience, we describe a pervasive tendency across psychological science to assume that essences explain phenomena. Labeling a complex phenomenon can appear as theoretical progress before there is sufficient evidence that the described category has a definable essence or known boundary conditions. Category labels can further undermine progress by masking contingent and contextual relationships and obscuring the need to specify mechanisms. Finally, we highlight examples of promising methods that circumvent the lure of essences and suggest four concrete strategies for identifying and avoiding essentialist intuitions in theory development. © The Author(s) 2021.",categories; essentialism; labels; metascience; natural kinds; validity,Perspectives on Psychological Science,Article,2022,35,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1177/1745691621991838

The academic environment has changed in the course of updating the research field and building up a new picture of the world, complex and diversified. The accumulation of “critical mass” of talented intellectual scholars based both in Africa and within the African Diaspora, focused on “breakthrough” in philosophy and epistemology, was reflected in an attack on the theoretical principles of postmodernism and Postcolonialism and a dynamic transformation of the conceptual principles and content of African studies. Contrary to Eurocentrism, Africa has become an epistemological laboratory, where the developing theories claiming to become metanarratives, within which new metalexemes and metagenres are emerging. Postcolonial discourse contains elements of metascience, a universal system of knowledge production. The interrelation of facts and methodology in their framework fully corresponds to the trends of the time in the era of algorithms, and their choice both forms the mechanisms of scientific knowledge, but also ensures success in the fight against stereotypes, not only racial and ethnic. The theoretical and methodological significance of postcolonial studies refers to the actualization of the “crossroad” problems in the history of Africa and the Diaspora, such as colonialism and decolonization, ethnicity and identity, hybridity and otherness, essentialism and transcendence, exodus and exile. In the present article the authors focus on the results of the interaction of researchers of African descent with postcolonial theory, as well as on the ideas of postcoloniality and decoloniality, which to a certain extent oppose each other. Particular attention is paid to the development of an updated epistemology of knowledge in the process of the formation of the “postcolonial library,” which includes the works of many scholars from Franz Fanon and Leopold Senghor to Kwame Anthony Appiah and Achille Mbembe. © 2022, RUDN UNiversity.

Through community analysis, it is found that when the scale of scientists' cooperative network increases, the increase in the number of communities is not obvious, but the scale of each community will increase, and the probability of scientists belonging to overlapping communities will decrease. This shows that the increase in the number of authoritative scientists is not obvious after the unpopular research field becomes a popular research field.

In response, methods have been introduced to address the problem and increase reproducibility, including two methods that are the focus here: (1) preregistration of study hypotheses and methods, and (2) analysis of whether p-hacking may have occurred through patterns of p-values. Each is easy to find, even in short summaries of research, but do consumers of research recognize these indicators as evidence of trustworthiness? In the current study, we examined how professionals (n = 111), researchers (n = 74) and undergraduate students (n = 78) judged the trustworthiness of short descriptions of research in their field, which varied in terms of whether there was a reference to a preregistration or evidence of potential p-hacking. Overall, participants trusted studies less when they were not preregistered. Researchers and professionals, but not students were sensitive to evidence of p-hacking. We suggest that education about questionable research practices like p-hacking and hypothesizing after the results are known needs to be improved. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society.

As of late 2020, approximately 100 RF bioeffects studies have been published involving exposures above 6 GHz, encompassing a wide range of exposure levels and frequencies. A majority of these studies report statistically significant effects of exposure, many at exposures within international safety limits. This commentary examines 31 genetic damage studies involving RF exposures above 6 GHz in the context of two sets of quality-assessment criteria: 1. ""Risk of bias""(RoB) criteria used for systematic reviews of health-related studies; and 2. a broader set of criteria for research quality from a different scholarly approach (metascience). The 31 studies report several statistically significant effects of exposure on different markers for genetic damage. These effects, if real, would have great potential significance for carcinogen risk assessment. However, the studies as a group have significant technical weaknesses, including small size, failure to meet multiple RoB criteria, naïve use of statistics, and lack of prespecified hypotheses and methods of analysis, all of which increase the chances of false discovery. Here we propose a ""carrot""(adequate funding to support high-quality research) and a ""stick""(more stringent review of bioeffects manuscripts, including explicit instructions to reviewers to assess study quality) approach to increase the reliability of RF bioeffects studies to facilitate health agency reviews of this socially controversial topic. © 2021 by Radiation Research Society.

Existing approaches rely on many years of leading citation values to predict a scientific paper's citations (a proxy for impact), even though most papers make their largest contributions in the first few years after they are published. In this paper, we tackle a new problem: predicting a new paper's citation time series from the date of publication (i.e., without leading values). We propose HINTS, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that converts citation signals from dynamic heterogeneous information networks (DHIN) into citation time series. HINTS imputes pseudo-leading values for a paper in the years before it is published from DHIN embeddings, and then transforms these embeddings into the parameters of a formal model that can predict citation counts immediately after publication. Empirical analysis on two real-world datasets from Computer Science and Physics show that HINTS is competitive with baseline citation prediction models. While we focus on citations, our approach generalizes to other ""cold start""time series prediction tasks where relational data is available and accurate prediction in early timestamps is crucial.

However, equally important for improving methodological rigour is a valid operationalization of phenomena. Operationalization is the process of translating theoretical constructs into measurable laboratory quantities. Thus, the validity of operationalization is central for the quality of empirical studies. But do differences in the validity of operationalization affect the way scientists evaluate scientific literature? To investigate this, we manipulated the strength of operationalization of three published studies and sent them to researchers via email. In the first task, researchers were presented with a summary of the Method and Result section from one of the studies and were asked to guess the hypothesis that was investigated via a multiple-choice questionnaire. In a second task, researchers were asked to rate the perceived quality of the study. Our results show that (1) researchers are better at inferring the underlying research question from empirical results if the operationalization is more valid, but (2) the different validity is only to some extent reflected in a judgement of the study's quality. These results combined give partial corroboration to the notion that researchers' evaluations of research results are not affected by operationalization validity. © 2021 The Authors.",construct validity; measurement; meta science; methodology; operationalization; replicability; replication crisis; reproducibility,Royal Society Open Science,Article,2021,8,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1098/rsos.191354

Through interviews, trace data collection, and observation of these various populations, I will explore how these stakeholders construct different technologies-in-practice. By taking the OSF not as a given, but as a technology whose purpose and effects are structured by the constraints and resources of its stakeholders, I will unpack the tensions among open science advocates, agnostics, and their use of technology.

Data recovery declines exponentially with time since publication, halving every 6 years, and up to every 9 years for human experimental data. When data for a publication can be recovered, we estimate a high probability of subsequent data usability (87%), analytical clarity (97%) and agreement of published results with reproduced findings (96%).

First, we searched the adopted dataset (Microsoft Academic Graph) for entries related to “bipolar junction transistor”. Community detection was then applied in order to derive sub-areas, which were tentatively labeled into 10 overall groups. This modular graph was then studied from several perspectives, taking into account topological measurements as well as time evolution. A number of interesting results are reported, including a good level of thematic coherence within each identified area, as well as the identification of distinct periods over time including the onset and coming of age of bipolar junction technology and related areas.

This trend has continued in recent decades in part because of professional psychology organizations reissuing calls to “give psychology away.” This recent wave of calls to give psychology away is different because it has been occurring alongside another movement in the field—the credibility revolution in which psychology has been reckoning with metascientific questions about what exactly psychologists know. This creates a dilemma for the modern psychologist: How is one to “give psychology away” if one is unsure about what is known or what one has to give?

Here, we use the SIR epidemic model as a mechanistic model for the citation dynamics of well-cited papers published in selected journals of the American Physical Society. The estimated epidemiological parameters offer insight into unknown quantities as the size of the community that could cite a paper and its ultimate impact on that community.

In this study, we used publication data from these new databases and added publication data from two established databases (Web of Science from Clarivate Analytics and Scopus from Elsevier) to investigate scientific growth processes from the beginning of the modern science system until today. We estimated regression models that included simultaneously the publication counts from the four databases.

As the comparison of various segmented regression models in the current study revealed, models with four or five segments fit the publication data best. We demonstrated that these segments with different growth rates can be interpreted very well, since they are related to either phases of economic (e.g., industrialization) and/or political developments (e.g., Second World War). In this study, we additionally analyzed scientific growth in two broad fields (Physical and Technical Sciences as well as Life Sciences) and the relationship of scientific and economic growth in UK.

For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase of participation of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the gender gap is shrinking. However, preliminary evidence suggests that women, including female researchers, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal distribution of childcare, elderly care, and other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. Sudden lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have had disproportionate consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop in research output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the number of female authors of scientific publications. Objective: The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate adverse effect on the productivity of female researchers in the biomedical field in terms of authorship of scientific publications. Methods: This is a retrospective observational bibliometric study. We investigated the proportion of male and female researchers who published scientific papers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using bibliometric data from biomedical preprint servers and selected Springer-Nature journals. We used the ordinary least squares regression model to estimate the expected proportions over time by correcting for temporal trends. We also used a set of statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regression discontinuity design, to test the validity of the results. Results: A total of 78,950 papers from the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories and from 62 selected Springer-Nature journals by 346,354 unique authors were analyzed. The acquired data set consisted of papers that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020. The proportion of female first authors publishing in the biomedical field during the pandemic dropped by 9.1%, on average, across disciplines (expected arithmetic mean yest=0.39; observed arithmetic mean y=0.35; standard error of the estimate, Sest=0.007; standard error of the observation, σx=0.004). The impact was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19 research, where the proportion of female scientists in the first author position dropped by 28% (yest=0.39; y=0.28; Sest=0.007; σx=0.007). When looking at the last authors, the proportion of women dropped by 7.9%, on average (yest=0.25; y=0.23; Sest=0.005; σx=0.003), while the proportion of women writing about COVID-19 as the last author decreased by 18.8% (yest=0.25; y=0.21; Sest=0.005; σx=0.007). Further, by geocoding authors' affiliations, we showed that the gender disparities became even more apparent when disaggregated by country, up to 35% in some cases. Conclusions: Our findings document a decrease in the number of publications by female authors in the biomedical field during the global pandemic. This effect was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19, indicating that women are producing fewer publications related to COVID-19 research. This sudden increase in the gender gap was persistent across the 10 countries with the highest number of researchers. These results should be used to inform the scientific community of this worrying trend in COVID-19 research and the disproportionate effect that the pandemic has had on female academics. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

It is important to understand the relative contribution of different factors towards generating variable results, including low sample sizes, researchers' flexibility in model choices, and measurement error in variables of interest and adjustment variables. Methods: We define sampling, model and measurement uncertainty, and extend the concept of vibration of effects in order to study these three types of uncertainty in a common framework. In a practical application, we examine these types of uncertainty in a Cox model using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In addition, we analyse the behaviour of sampling, model and measurement uncertainty for varying sample sizes in a simulation study. Results: All types of uncertainty are associated with a potentially large variability in effect estimates. Measurement error in the variable of interest attenuates the true effect in most cases, but can occasionally lead to overestimation. When we consider measurement error in both the variable of interest and adjustment variables, the vibration of effects are even less predictable as both systematic under- and over-estimation of the true effect can be observed. The results on simulated data show that measurement and model vibration remain non-negligible even for large sample sizes. Conclusion: Sampling, model and measurement uncertainty can have important consequences for the stability of observational associations. We recommend systematically studying and reporting these types of uncertainty, and comparing them in a common framework.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.",Measurement error; Metascience; Observational study; Replicability; Researcher degrees of freedom; Stability,International Journal of Epidemiology,Article,2021,14,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1093/ije/dyaa164

I reconstruct the research trajectory of a group of neurobiologists in the United States, with a focus on the experimental practices they adopted while building this animal model. Providing a microhistory of this decade-long undertaking, I show that what drove the development of the model in practice was a serendipitous finding about infants’ response to maternal separation. Detected inadvertently, the pup’s separation response acquired an epistemic significance of its own and reoriented the experimental system towards unanticipated paths. To explain this intriguing phenomenon, the neurobiologists kept on refining their material manipulations and stabilizing their experimental outcomes. They thus established a series of causal relationships that connected dysregulations of the infant’s physiological systems to disruptions in maternal care. As important as this interactive stabilization of technique and objects in the laboratory was how the researchers theorized the network of relationships derived from this technically constituted objectivity. Highlighting the practice-driven aspects of model-building, I demonstrate that what facilitated this theoretical process was an integrated design of complementary experiments. The outcome of each separate experiment of the research program came to bear upon the outcomes of other experiments, informing the development of future manipulations. It was this strategically driven integration process that allowed the experimenters to build expanding networks of causal relationships and consolidate them into a neurobiological theory. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Experimentation; History of neurobiology; Metascience; Multiple-experiment research programs; Philosophy of neuroscience; Theory-building,History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences,Article,2021,0,NA,English,10.1007/s40656-021-00448-w

Here we examined the role of gender in peer-reviewed publications in psychology, with a focus on generic language. When authors describe their results using generic statements (e.g., “Introverts and extraverts require different learning environments”), those statements gloss over variability, frame an idea as broad, timeless, and universally true, and have been judged to be more important. In a sample of 1,149 psychology articles published in 2015–16 from 11 journals, we found that women in lead author positions were less likely to employ generic language than men in lead author positions, and that publications with more generic language received more citations (as did publications authored by men).

It compares and contrasts with the birth and development of the Soviet Union science discipline bred under Bukharin thought, which helps clarify the development of patterns and development of conditions of science discipline. This paper mainly refers to the Soviet Union and Chinaś historical documents and analyzes the theoretical logic on Bukharinś scientific thoughts. At the same time, it also contains in - depth interviews with the historical witnesses who have experienced the important events in the discipline establishment and development of the science of science in China to restore the panorama of the events under the background of the times much as possible. By comparing the origin and development of science between China and the Soviet Union, this paper clarifies the practical logic of its further development after its establishment and summarizes the necessary conditions for its development. It means one must recognize the inherent law of scientific development and respect the objective law. In the early 20th century, the science of science was first born in the Soviet Union under the influence of Bukharinś thought of science, which impacted the productive forces and relations of production in the Soviet Union. This idea gradually spread to China to form a small influence, but soon in the 1950s and 1960s, the development of the science of science came to a standstill and was not established smoothly. To explore why the science of science in China did not establish smoothly in the 1950s and 1960s. The author compares the theoretical logic of the development of the science of Science in the Soviet Union with the practical logic of developing the science of science in China. Finds that there are theoretical defects in the development of the science of Science in China. This theoretical defect is that Chinese scholars can not compromise the subject orientation of the science of science. The development of the science of science in the Soviet Union is mainly aimed at exploring the inherent law of scientific development and its influence mechanism on productivity. However, Chinese scholars lack discussion on the causality of production relations and productivity in scientific research activities and deal with the theoretical differences by shelving them. They only point out that it is necessary to adhere to Marxist theoryś guidance, which leads to the lack of motivation for scientific research to develop rapidly. During the Cultural Revolution, the "" Gang of Four"" proposed to replace natural science with philosophy and denied the promoting effect of science on production. During this period, the science of science was not born smoothly. It was not until after the end of the Cultural Revolution that the Party and the state - required emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, and focusing scientific research on the inherent laws existing in the process of scientific development. Five years later, in 1982, the science of science in China formed a disciplinary system. Reviewing the historical experience gained from the stagnation and re - development of science in China in the last century, we should avoid repeating the past mistakes in the development of the science of Science in China. We should deal with the relationship between "" seeking truth"" and "" being practical,"" explore the inevitable relationship between scientific and technological progress and the coordinated development of economy and society based on empirical research, carry forward the scientific spirit, and carry out scientific research guided by Chinaś problems realistically. © 2021 Editorial Department of Studies in Science of Science.

But the embodied cognition literature, generally speaking, lacks the formal theorizing that allows for specific predictions about relations between body and mind. This problem is amplified by the fact that psychological research has encountered replication problems, challenges to validity of measures and manipulations, and overgeneralization of obtained findings to populations and measures that were not tested. This chapter provides a tutorial on how the field can move towards formalized theories of embodied social cognition. We rely on research on social thermoregulation—the idea that social behaviors protect the body’s core temperature—as a template for our tutorial. The chapter addresses the important questions of how to separate noise from signal in embodiment research, how to create reliable and valid measures, and how to appropriately draw conclusions about the generalizability of obtained findings. We hope that following these recommendations will help theories in embodiment to become more formal, allowing for precise predictions about interactions between the body and human (social) cognition. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

We demonstrate that our periodical embeddings encode nuanced relationships between periodicals and the complex disciplinary and interdisciplinary structure of science, allowing us to make cross-disciplinary analogies between periodicals. Furthermore, we show that the embeddings capture meaningful “axes” that encompass knowledge domains, such as an axis from “soft” to “hard” sciences or from “social” to “biological” sciences, which allow us to quantitatively ground periodicals on a given dimension. By offering novel quantification in the science of science, our framework may, in turn, facilitate the study of how knowledge is created and organized.

At the beginning of the 21st century, with the introduction of the concept of knowmetrics, the visualisation method of mapping knowledge domain took SciSci into its third phase.

In principle, the assessment of scientific claims is supposed to proceed in a cumulative fashion, with the reigning theories of the day progressively approximating truth more accurately over time. In practice, however, cumulative self-correction tends to proceed less efficiently than one might naively suppose. Far from evaluating new evidence dispassionately and infallibly, individual scientists often cling stubbornly to prior findings. Here we explore the dynamics of scientific self-correction at an individual rather than collective level. In 13 written statements, researchers from diverse branches of psychology share why and how they have lost confidence in one of their own published findings. We qualitatively characterize these disclosures and explore their implications. A cross-disciplinary survey suggests that such loss-of-confidence sentiments are surprisingly common among members of the broader scientific population yet rarely become part of the public record. We argue that removing barriers to self-correction at the individual level is imperative if the scientific community as a whole is to achieve the ideal of efficient self-correction. © The Author(s) 2021.",incentive structure; knowledge accumulation; metascience; scientific errors; scientific falsification; self-correction,Perspectives on Psychological Science,Article,2021,24,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1177/1745691620964106

A recent finding shows that teams of both large and small sizes are essential in research, prompting us to analyze the extent to which a country’s scientific work is carried out by big or small teams. Here, using over 26 million publications from Web of Science, we find that China’s research output is more dominated by big teams than the rest of the world, which is particularly the case in fields of natural science. Despite the global trend that more papers are written by big teams, China’s drop in small team output is much steeper. As teams in China shift from small to large size, the team diversity that is essential for innovative work does not increase as much as that in other countries. Using the national average as the baseline, we find that the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) supports fewer small teams than the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the United States does, implying that big teams are preferred by grant agencies in China. Our finding provides new insights into the concern of originality and innovation in China, which indicates a need to balance small and big teams. © 2020 Linlin Liu, Jianfei Yu, Junming Huang, Feng Xia, and Tao Jia.

However, we know little about funder collaborations and the impact of collaboratively funded projects. As an initial effort towards this, we examine the co-funding network, where a funder represents a node and an edge signifies collaboration. Our core data include all papers that cite and receive citations by the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, a prominent clinical review journal. We find that 65% of clinical papers have multiple funders and discover communities of funders that are formed by national boundaries and funding objectives. To quantify success in funding, we use a g-index metric that indicates efficiency of funders in supporting clinically relevant research. After controlling for authorship, we find that funders generally achieve higher success when collaborating than when solo-funding. We also find that as a funder, seeking multiple, direct connections with various disconnected funders may be more beneficial than being part of a densely interconnected network of co-funders.

For Parisi, cybernetics names a “historical reconfiguration of metaphysics on behalf of technics.” This interview asks about the meaning and consequences of this hypothesis but steers away from the all-too-easy poiesis-as-panacea solution to the computational quagmire. Instead, this interview descends into the computational medium, into the specificity of its logic, asking what it might mean not merely to live in a cyberneticized world but to actively participate and believe in such a world. Parisi’s response puts to philosophy an important task: not to seek the accommodations of an expanding concept of the human within a machinic world but to think with the logic of the ascendant cybernetic metaphysics. For Parisi, a necessary move herein is to negotiate the reality of the algorithm’s syntactic operations, their performativity, a move that for her implies a certain form of belief. In tracking this form of belief across disciplines, this interview broaches questions of scalability, race and colonialism, the nonneutrality of technoscience, and the potential of computational aesthetics. Finally, the interview gestures toward Parisi’s future work, because, as she reminds us, we cannot go back; there are questions emerging from within machines that are eager to emerge and are waiting for us to think them. © 2021, Duke University Press.

From these, Computer Science appears to among the worst. The imbalance comes despite the fact that, the proportion of women publishing impactful papers has increased over the last couple of decades. Here, we explore the potential gender differences in collaboration dynamics of leading academics in Computer Science and contrast it with other researchers in the same discipline. This work aims to demonstrate that productivity patterns differ between men and women; understanding such patterns is fundamental to improving the current situation by driving well-thought interventions. We start by looking at topological features of academics ego-networks and their variability over their career lifespan; we found that women have a higher rate of repeated collaborators, while men have slightly more new collaborators. Second, we show gender differences in the acquisition patterns and maintenance of collaborations over the researchers' careers. Third, we look at alters' gender composition and gender role in introducing new collaborations to researchers and found that women are more homophilic than men and that the gender of the person being introduced (alter) tends to match the gender of the ego (the researcher). Last, we show that women reach their highest productivity levels earlier in their careers than men, but the levels attained are not at the same magnitude as men. Our work highlights the importance of studying gender differences by productivity levels, the role of gender-mixed groups in academia and the relation to academic production within these groups.

Bakhurst D.,24469971000,"Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada",Evald Ilyenkov: Philosophy as the science of thought,"This chapter is devoted to the most influential and important Soviet philosopher of the post-Stalin era: Evald Vasilevich Ilyenkov (1924-1979). Ilyenkov burst on the scene in the early 1950s, arguing that Ilyenkov should be understood, not as a meta-science concerned to formulate the most general laws of being, but as ""the science of thought."" The chapter explores how Ilyenkov developed this idea, beginning with the controversial Ilyenkov-Korovikov theses and his unpublished ""phantasmagoria,"" ""The Cosmology of Spirit."" Bakhurst then turns to Ilyenkov's influential writing on scientific method, which portrays cognition as an ""ascent from the abstract to the concrete,"" and to his now-famous solution to ""the problem of the ideal,"" which represents the concept of activity as the key to understanding both the nature of objectively existing ideal forms and the possibility of human minds. Bakhurst shows how Ilyenkov's views on these issues inform his critique of scientism and positivism in Soviet thought and inspire his distinctive conception of education, exemplified by his contribution to Alexander Meshcheryakov's work on the education of blind-deaf children. Although Ilyenkov styled himself as a dialectical materialist and a Leninist, his ideas were in tension with orthodox Soviet philosophy and he was often in trouble with the Soviet philosophical establishment, which found it hard to tolerate what it saw as Ilyenkov's dalliance with idealism as well as his call for the cultivation of critical, free, creative thinkers. Bakhurst concludes by reflecting on the many crises Ilyenkov experienced during his career, exploring how he was frequently subject to criticism and persecution. This, combined with his disappointment over the suppression of the Prague Spring, eventually led to his untimely death by his own hand in March 1979. © The Author(s), 2021.

We discuss why some trivial measures can be ineffective, and as a consequence, we built the global scientific migration network to identify the most important countries involved in the mobility of scholars, and to study their role at a local and a global scale. For such a purpose, we analysed a temporal directed weighted network representing scientists moving from one country to another, from 2000 to 2016, built on top of 2.8 million ORCID public profiles. With the support of the well-known HITS algorithm, we found hubs and authorities to study the interplay between providing and attracting researchers from a global perspective, and its relationship to other structural features. Our findings highlight the presence of a set of countries acting both as hubs and authorities, occupying a privileged position in the Scientific Migration Network, that is network of the scientific migrations, and having similar local characteristics, i.e., several neighbours with highly differentiated flows of researchers moving from/to them. However, it is striking that some of these countries have a predominant role over the others, and that we can easily observe countries that are extremely more attractive than others, as well as other countries that perform better as exporters than importers of scientists. It is also interesting that hubs and authorities scores can change over time, alongside with their relative discrepancy, and other network measures, suggesting that local and/or global policies can buck the trend. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Complex networks analysis; Hyperlink-induced topic search; Science of science; Scientific migration,Online Social Networks and Media,Article,2021,4,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.osnem.2021.100176

This is a problem for transparency in the scientific record, along with reproducibility and metascience. Following lessons learned in the high complexity fields of aviation and surgery, we conclude that new tools are needed to overcome the limitations of written methodology descriptions, and that these tools should be developed through community consultation to ensure that they have the most utility for EEG stakeholders. As a first step in tool development, we present the ARTEM-IS Statement describing what action will be needed to create an Agreed Reporting Template for Electroencephalography Methodology - International Standard (ARTEM-IS), along with ARTEM-IS Design Guidelines for developing tools that use an evidence-based approach to error reduction. We first launched the statement at the LiveMEEG conference in 2020 along with a draft of an ARTEM-IS template for public consultation.

With the growing availability of large-scale well-documented academic profiles and career trajectories, scholarly interest in career success has been reinvigorated, which has emerged to be an active research domain called the Science of Science (i.e., SciSci). In this study, we adopt an innovative dynamic perspective to examine how individual and social factors will influence career success over time. We propose ACSeeker, an interactive visual analytics approach to explore the potential factors of success and how the influence of multiple factors changes at different stages of academic careers. We first applied a Multi-factor Impact Analysis framework to estimate the effect of different factors on academic career success over time. We then developed a visual analytics system to understand the dynamic effects interactively. A novel timeline is designed to reveal and compare the factor impacts based on the whole population. A customized career line showing the individual career development is provided to allow a detailed inspection. To validate the effectiveness and usability of ACSeeker, we report two case studies and interviews with a social scientist and general researchers.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.",Academic Profiles; Career Analysis; Citation Data; Publication Data; Science of Science; Sequence Analysis,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,Article,2022,16,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114790

The three paradigms are one for which the corpus of research points to a real finding, one for which the corpus of research points to a significantly attenuated effect, and one for which the debate is ongoing. We then discuss what scientists can learn—and how science can be improved—through replications more generally. From there, we discuss what we believe needs to be done to improve scientific inquiry with regard to replication moving forward.

This work focuses on scientific networks as a social network having different nodes and connections. Nodes can be represented by authors, articles or journals while connections by citation, co-citation or co-authorship. One of the challenges in creating scientific networks is the lack of publicly available comprehensive data set. It limits the variety of analyses on the same set of nodes of different scientific networks. To supplement such analyses we have worked on publicly available citation metadata from Crossref and OpenCitatons. Using this data a workflow is developed to create scientific networks. Analysis of these networks gives insights into academic research and scholarship. Different techniques of social network analysis have been applied in the literature to study these networks. It includes centrality analysis, community detection, and clustering coefficient. We have used metadata of Scientometrics journal, as a case study, to present our workflow. We did a sample run of the proposed workflow to identify prominent authors using centrality analysis. This work is not a bibliometric study of any field rather it presents replicable Python scripts to perform network analysis. With an increase in the popularity of open access and open metadata, we hypothesise that this workflow shall provide an avenue for understanding scientific scholarship in multiple dimensions.

(doi:10.1038/s41562-019-0787-z)) compared effect size estimates derived from these two different methods for 15 different psychological phenomena. The authors reported that, for the same phenomenon, the meta-Analytic estimate tended to be about three times larger than the MLR estimate. These results are a specific example of a broader question: What is the relationship between meta-Analysis and MLR estimates? Kvarven et al. suggested that their results undermine the value of meta-Analysis. By contrast, we argue that both meta-Analysis and MLR are informative, and that the discrepancy between the two estimates that they observed is in fact still largely unexplained. Informed by re-Analyses of Kvarven et al. s data and by other empirical evidence, we discuss possible sources of this discrepancy and argue that understanding the relationship between estimates obtained from these two methods is an important puzzle for future meta-scientific research. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

Frequentist techniques are often claimed to be incorrectly interpreted as Bayesian outcomes, which suggests that a Bayesian framework may fit better to inferences researchers frequently want to make (Briggs, 2012). The current study set out to test this proposition. Firstly, we investigated whether there is a discrepancy between what researchers think they can conclude and what they want to be able to conclude from NHST. Secondly, we investigated to what extent researchers want to incorporate prior study results and their personal beliefs in their statistical inference. Results show the expected discrepancy between what researchers think they can conclude from NHST and what they want to be able to conclude. Furthermore, researchers were interested in incorporating prior study results, but not their personal beliefs, into their statistical inference. © This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY-4.0).

Metascientific activists have advocated policies that incentivize replications and make them more diagnostically potent. We argue that current debates, as well as research in science and technology studies, have paid little heed to a key dimension of replication practice. Although it sometimes serves a diagnostic function, replication is commonly motivated by a practical desire to extend research interests. The resulting replication, which we label ‘integrative’, is characterized by a pragmatic flexibility toward protocols. The goal is to appropriate what is useful, not test for truth. Within many experimental cultures, however, integrative replications can produce replications of ambiguous diagnostic power. Based on interviews with 60 members of the Board of Reviewing Editors for the journal Science, we show how the interplay between the diagnostic and integrative motives for replication differs between fields and produces different cultures of replication. We offer six theses that aim to put science and technology studies and science activism into dialog to show why effective reforms will need to confront issues of disciplinary difference. © The Author(s) 2021.",metascience; replication; reproducibility crisis; science policy,Social Studies of Science,Article,2021,20,NA,English,10.1177/03063127211005551

We explored this possibility in the current article. We conducted a scoping review to assess the extent to which the information needed for implementation is reported in psychological intervention articles. Results suggest psychological intervention articles report, at most, 64% of the information needed to implement interventions.

In science education, Nature of Science (NOS), in its different forms of educational scaffoldings, seeks to provide with students an understanding of features of scientific knowledge and science in general, how scientific knowledge changes and becomes accepted, and what factors guide scientific activities. For a science teacher, deep and broad enough picture of sciences is therefore of importance. This study attempts to show that the research field called Science of Science (SoS) can significantly support building such a panoramic picture of sciences, and through that, significantly support NOS. The SoS approaches the structure and dynamics of science quantitatively, using scientific documents (e.g., publications, reports, books and monographs and patent applications) as trails to map the landscape of sciences. It is argued here that SoS may provide material and interesting cases for NOS, and in so doing enrich NOS in a similarly significant way as history, philosophy and sociology of science (HPSS) scholarship has done thus far. This study introduces several themes based on SoS that are of relevance for NOS as they were introduced and discussed in a pre-service science teachers’ course. The feedback from pre-service teachers shows that introducing SoS, with minimal additional philosophical interpretations and discussions, but simply as evidential facts and findings, sparks ideas and views that come very close to NOS themes and topics. Discussions related to nature of science, and specific educational NOS scaffoldings for it, can find a good companion in SoS; the latter providing facts and evidence of thee structure and dynamics of sciences, the former providing perspectives for interpretations. © 2021 by the author.

These include the analysis of the Nobel Prize, including physics, chemistry, medicine, etc. In this article, we extract and analyze the data of 72 Turing Award laureates from the complete bibliographic data, fill the gap in the lack of Turing Award analysis, and discover the development characteristics of CS as an independent discipline. First, we show most Turing Award laureates have long-term and high-quality educational backgrounds, and more than 61% of them have a degree in mathematics, which indicates that mathematics has played a significant role in the development of CS. Secondly, the data shows that not all scholars have high productivity and high h-index; that is, the number of publications and h-index is not the leading indicator for evaluating the Turing Award. Third, the average age of awardees has increased from 40 to around 70 in recent years. This may be because new breakthroughs take longer, and some new technologies need time to prove their influence. Besides, we have also found that in the past 10 years, international collaboration has experienced explosive growth, showing a new paradigm in the form of collaboration. It is also worth noting that in recent years, the emergence of female winners has also been eye-catching.

In this paper, we report an analysis of the organization and the interconnection between unbalanced areas of study. More specifically, we considered two important subareas in analytical chemistry, namely capillary electrophoresis (CE) and mass spectrometry (MS). These areas are particularly interesting because MS is employed in a bigger range of applications than CE. Consequently, these different portions of papers can interfere in the quality of the searches for papers devoted to CE–MS. Here, we considered a citation network in which the nodes and connections represent papers and citations, respectively. The network clusters were detected by employing the Infomap algorithm. By considering the clusters and the respective abstracts, the subjects were identified. Interesting results were found, including a marked separation between some clusters of articles devoted to instrumentation techniques and applications, which was quantified from the abstract contents. For instance, the most well-defined community was assigned as CE (Instru.), with 73.8% of the papers having abstracts that include the word “electrophoresis” and not the word “mass”. However, the papers that describe CE–MS did not lead to a well-defined cluster. In order to better understand the organization of the citation network, we considered a multi-scale analysis, in which we used the information regarding sub-clusters. Firstly, we analyzed the sub-cluster that contains the first article devoted to the coupling between CE and MS, whose subject was found to be a good representation of its sub-cluster. The second analysis was about the sub-cluster of a seminal paper known to be the first that dealt with protein analysis by using CE–MS and a similar result was obtained. By considering the proposed methodologies, our paper can contribute to researchers working with similar scenarios, since it shows that a given subject can be spread on many clusters of the network, therefore, lead to better literature reviews. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Capillary electrophoresis; CE–MS; Mass spectrometry; Netowork science; Science of science,Scientometrics,Article,2021,6,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1007/s11192-021-03923-0

Do differences in these contributions partially explain disparities in academic career outcomes? We explore this by looking at how gender is embodied in research language, and then ascertain whether the adoption of more gendered research language affects career outcomes beyond the researcher's attributes. We identify different forms of gendered knowledge—gender referents (explicit references to sex and gender) and gender-associated terms (words that are implicitly associated with women or men researchers)—by applying natural language processing techniques to nearly one million doctoral dissertations published in the United States between 1980 and 2010. We then determine whether employing gender referents and gender-associated terms affects the course of PhDs’ ensuing careers. We find women researchers have lower chances of securing academic positions than men in every field; explicit references to women as research subjects are modestly rewarded in comparison to references to men; and more career opportunities are afforded to research knowledge associated with men. These results suggest that academia is slowly correcting the traditional and explicit bias of studying men at the exclusion of women.

Communicating environmental problems with “slow impacts” has long been a challenge for scientists, public health officials, and science communicators, as the time delay for subsequent consequences to become evident dilutes the sense of urgency to act. Fortunately, scientific research and practice in the field of climate change communication has begun to identify best practices to address these challenges. Climate change demonstrates a delay between environmental stressor and impact, and recommended practices for climate change communication illustrate how to explain and motivate action around this complex environmental problem. Climate change communication research provides scientific understanding of how people evaluate risk and scientific information about climate change. We used a qualitative coding approach to review the science communication and climate change communication literature to identify approaches that could be used for nutrients and how they could be applied. Recognizing the differences between climate change and impacts of nutrient pollution, we also explore how environmental problems with delayed impacts demand nuanced strategies for effective communication and public engagement. Applying generalizable approaches to successfully communicate the slow impacts related to nutrient pollution across geographic contexts will help build publics’ understanding and urgency to act on comprehensive management of nutrient pollution, thereby increasing protection of coastal and marine environments. © Copyright © 2021 Canfield, Mulvaney and Merrill.",climate change communication; nutrient communication; nutrient management; science communication; science of science communication,Frontiers in Environmental Science,Article,2021,6,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.3389/fenvs.2021.619606

Research topic overlap and the formation of scientific teams","Over the last century scientific research has become an increasingly collaborative endeavor. Commentators have pointed to different factors which contribute to this trend, including the specialization of science and growing need for diversity of interest and expertise areas in a scientific team. Very few studies, however, have precisely evaluated how the diversity of interest topics between researchers is related to the emergence of collaboration. Existing theoretical arguments suggest a curvilinear relationship between topic similarity and collaboration: too little similarity can complicate communication and agreement, yet too much overlap can increase competition and limit the potential for synergy. We test this idea using data on six years of publications across all disciplines at a large U.S. research university (approximately 14,300 articles, 12,500 collaborations, and 3400 authors). Employing topic modelling and network statistical models, we analyze the relationship between topic overlap and the likelihood of coauthorship between two researchers while controlling for potential confounders. We find an inverted-U relationship in which the probability of collaboration initially increases with topic similarity, then rapidly declines after peaking at a similarity ""sweet spot"". Collaboration is most likely at low-to-moderate levels of topic overlap, which are substantially lower than the average self-similarity of scientists or research groups. These findings - which we replicate for different units of analysis (individuals and groups), genders of collaborators, disciplines, and collaboration types (intra- and interdisciplinary) - support the notion that researchers seek collaborators to augment their scientific and technical human capital. We discuss implications for theories of scientific collaboration and research policy.  © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.",Collaboration; Exponential random graph models; Latent semantic analysis; Science of science; Team science; Topic modeling,Journal of Informetrics,Article,2021,25,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.joi.2020.101104

It is quite surprising, after such a long time, and considering how much the author’s proposal was debated during the last four decades, to find a new review of it on the March issue of Metascience. In “Concluding Unscientific Image”, Hans Halvorson claims that, in the work of the founder of constructive empiricism, not only is there a defense of an anti-realist perspective on science—and, at the same time, a critique of scientific realism—, but also a revolt against the way of doing philosophy that, since Quine, seemed to be hegemonic in analytical philosophy. The present study focuses on Halvorson’s allegations about what maintaining the empirical adequacy of a theory would encompass—and that, according to him, van Fraassen has in mind—and aims at showing that, perhaps, they do not correspond to what van Fraassen actually defends in his book. © 2021, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

But are they cited more often because those articles are somehow more “citable”? Or are they cited more often simply because they are published in a high-impact journal? Although some evidence suggests the latter, the causal relationship is not clear. We here compare citations of preprints to citations of the published version to uncover the causal mechanism.Webuild on an earlier model of citation dynamics to infer the causal effect of journals on citations. We find that high-impact journals select articles that tend to attract more citations. At the same time, we find that high-impact journals augment the citation rate of published articles. Our results yield a deeper understanding of the role of journals in the research system. The use of journal metrics in research evaluation has been increasingly criticized in recent years and article-level citations are sometimes suggested as an alternative. Our results show that removing impact factors from evaluation does not negate the influence of journals. This insight has important implications for changing practices of research evaluation. © 2021 V. A.

The overwhelming amount of available literature makes a holistic analysis of the research within a field and between fields based on manual inspection impossible. Automatic techniques to support the process of literature review are required to find the epistemic and social patterns that are embedded in scientific publications. In computer sciences, new tools have been developed to deal with large volumes of data. In particular, deep learning techniques open the possibility of automated end-to-end models to project observations to a new, low-dimensional space where the most relevant information of each observation is highlighted. Using deep learning to build new representations of scientific publications is a growing but still emerging field of research. The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential and limits of deep learning for gathering insights about scientific research articles. We focus on document-level embeddings based on the semantic and relational aspects of articles, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We explore the different outcomes generated by those techniques.

Using an exhaustive set of over 2.4 million Scopus publications, we analyze all researchers who have published with a Russian affiliation address in Scopus-indexed sources in 1996–2020. The migration of researchers is observed through the changes in their affiliation addresses, which altered their mode countries of affiliation across different years. While only 5.2% of these researchers were internationally mobile, they accounted for a substantial proportion of citations. Our estimates of net migration rates indicate that while Russia was a donor country in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it has experienced a relatively balanced circulation of researchers in more recent years. These findings suggest that the current trends in scholarly migration in Russia could be better framed as brain circulation, rather than as brain drain. Overall, researchers emigrating from Russia outnumbered and outperformed researchers immigrating to Russia. Our analysis on the subject categories of publication venues shows that in the past 25 years, Russia has, overall, suffered a net loss in most disciplines, and most notably in the five disciplines of neuroscience, decision sciences, mathematics, biochemistry, and pharmacology.

There are studies focusing on the overall performance of individuals with different problem choosing strategies. Here we ask a slightly different but relatively unexplored question: how is a scientist's change of research agenda associated with her change of scientific performance. Using publication records of over 14,000 authors in physics, we quantitatively measure the extent of research direction change and the performance change of individuals. We identify a strong positive correlation between the direction change and impact change. Scientists with a larger direction change not only are more likely to produce works with increased scientific impact compared to their past ones, but also have a higher growth rate of scientific impact. On the other hand, the direction change is not associated with productivity change. Those who stay in familiar topics do not publish faster than those who venture out and establish themselves in a new field. The gauge of research direction in this work is uncorrelated with the diversity of research agenda and the switching probability among topics, capturing the evolution of individual careers from a new point of view.

In an open review paradigm, our findings indicate that peer reviewers’ choice to reveal their names in lieu of remaining anonymous may be associated with more positive sentiment in their review, implying possible social pressure from name association.

In the present article, I lay the groundwork for extending this credibility revolution to careers science. To inspire such a revolution, I provide ten recommendations, which serve as a means toward increasing the credibility of careers science and vocational behavior research. These ten recommendations reflect features of the research process which, if adopted universally, would bolster the credibility of careers science.

Dark data is due to publication bias toward novel results that confirm investigator hypotheses and omission of data that do not. Publication bias contributes to scientific irreproducibility and failures in bench-to-bedside translation. Sharing dark data by making it Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) may reduce the burden of irreproducible science by increasing transparency and support data-driven discoveries beyond the lifecycle of the original study. We illustrate feasibility of dark data sharing by recovering original raw data from the Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study (MASCIS), an NIH-funded multi-site preclinical drug trial conducted in the 1990s that tested efficacy of several therapies after a spinal cord injury (SCI). The original drug treatments did not produce clear positive results and MASCIS data were stored in boxes for more than two decades. The goal of the present study was to independently confirm published machine learning findings that perioperative blood pressure is a major predictor of SCI neuromotor outcome (Nielson et al., 2015). We recovered, digitized, and curated the data from 1125 rats from MASCIS.

Field sciences offer a compelling context to ask these questions because query selection and adaptation involves consideration of the spatiotemporal arrangement of data, and therefore closely parallels classic search and foraging behavior. Here we conduct a novel simulated data foraging study—and a complementary real-world case study—to determine how spatiotemporal data collection decisions are made in field sciences, and how search is adapted in response to in-situ data. Expert geoscientists evaluated a hypothesis by collecting environmental data using a mobile robot. At any point, participants were able to stop the robot and change their search strategy or make a conclusion about the hypothesis. We identified spatiotemporal reasoning heuristics, to which scientists strongly anchored, displaying limited adaptation to new data. We analyzed two key decision factors: variable-space coverage, and fitting error to the hypothesis. We found that, despite varied search strategies, the majority of scientists made a conclusion as the fitting error converged. Scientists who made premature conclusions, due to insufficient variable-space coverage or before the fitting error stabilized, were more prone to incorrect conclusions. We found that novice undergraduates used the same heuristics as expert geoscientists in a simplified version of the scenario. We believe the findings from this study could be used to improve field science training in data foraging, and aid in the development of technologies to support data collection decisions. © 2021, The Author(s).",Human–robot interaction; Information foraging; Information search; Metascience; Spatial heuristics,Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications,Article,2021,3,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1186/s41235-021-00296-z

Being partially rooted in CS conferences, ""AI ethics""(AIE) conferences such as FAccT and AIES have quickly become distinct venues where AI's societal implications are discussed and solutions proposed. However, it is largely unknown if these conferences improve upon the historical representational issues of traditional CS venues. In this work, we explore AIE conferences' evolution and compare them across demographic characteristics, publication content, and citation patterns. We find that AIE conferences have increased their internal topical diversity and impact on other CS conferences. Importantly, AIE conferences are highly differentiable, covering topics not represented in other venues. However, and perhaps contrary to the field's aspirations, white authors are more common while seniority and black researchers are represented similarly to CS venues. Our results suggest that AIE conferences could increase efforts to attract more diverse authors, especially considering their sizable roots in CS. © 2021 Owner/Author.",artificial intelligence; content and citation analyses; ethics conferences; science of science,"AIES 2021 - Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",Conference paper,2021,4,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,English,10.1145/3461702.3462616

Drawing on our research studying the metascience movement, we suggest that the drive to maximize efficiency in science is increasingly extending beyond performance metrics, into labs themselves. Because institutional and public audiences are predisposed to viewing science in simple terms, it can be challenging for scientists to articulate counterarguments to policies that increase transparency and accountability in the name of efficiency.

Policy measures aim to increase the quantity of scientists, research funding, and scientific output, which is measured by the number of papers produced. These quantitative metrics determine the career trajectories of scholars and evaluations of academic departments, institutions, and nations. Whether and how these increases in the numbers of scientists and papers translate into advances in knowledge is unclear, however. Here, we first lay out a theoretical argument for why too many papers published each year in a field can lead to stagnation rather than advance. The deluge of new papers may deprive reviewers and readers the cognitive slack required to fully recognize and understand novel ideas. Competition among many new ideas may prevent the gradual accumulation of focused attention on a promising new idea. Then, we show data supporting the predictions of this theory. When the number of papers published per year in a scientific field grows large, citations flow disproportionately to already well-cited papers; the list of most-cited papers ossifies; new papers are unlikely to ever become highly cited, and when they do, it is not through a gradual, cumulative process of attention gathering; and newly published papers become unlikely to disrupt existing work. These findings suggest that the progress of large scientific fields may be slowed, trapped in existing canon. Policy measures shifting how scientific work is produced, disseminated, consumed, and rewarded may be called for to push fields into new, more fertile areas of study. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Currently, the evaluation of scientific productivity by academic institutions and funders has been heavily reliant upon the number of publications and citations, raising questions about the adequacy of such mechanisms to reward data generation and sharing. This article provides a systematic review of the current and proposed incentive mechanisms for researchers in biomedical sciences and discusses their strengths and weaknesses. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were queried for original research articles, editorials, and opinion articles on incentives for data sharing. Articles were included if they discussed incentive mechanisms for data sharing, were applicable to biomedical sciences, and were written in English. Results: Although coauthorship in return for the sharing of data is common, this might be incompatible with authorship guidelines and raise concerns over the ability of secondary analysts to contest the proposed research methods or conclusions that are drawn. Data publication, citation, and altmetrics have been proposed as alternative routes to credit data generators, which could address these disadvantages. Their primary downsides are that they are not well-established, it is difficult to acquire evidence to support their implementation, and that they could be gamed or give rise to novel forms of research misconduct. Conclusions: Alternative recognition mechanisms need to be more commonly used to generate evidence on their power to stimulate data sharing, and to assess where they fall short. There is ample discussion in policy documents on alternative crediting systems to work toward Open Science, which indicates that that there is an interest in working out more elaborate metascience programs.  © 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",coauthorship; data sharing; ethics; incentives; science policy,Biopreservation and Biobanking,Review,2021,20,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1089/bio.2020.0037

Moruzzi 1, Pisa, 56124, Italy",The academic wanderer: structure of collaboration network and relation with research performance,"Thanks to the widespread availability of large-scale datasets on scholarly outputs, science itself has come under the microscope with the aim of capturing a quantitative understanding of its workings. In this study, we leverage well-established cognitive models coming from anthropology in order to characterise the personal network of collaborations between scientists, i.e., the network considered from the standpoint of each individual researcher (referred to as ego network), in terms of the cognitive investment they devote to the different collaborations. Building upon these models, we study the interplay between the structure of academic collaborations, academic performance, and academic mobility at different career stages. We take into account both purely academic mobility (i.e., the number of affiliation changes) and geographical mobility (i.e., physical relocations to different countries). For our investigation, we rely on a dataset comprising the geo-referenced publications of a group of 81,500 authors extracted from Scopus, one of the biggest repositories of academic knowledge. Our main finding is that there is a clear correlation between the structure of co-authorship ego networks and academic performance indices: the more one publishes and the higher their impact, the larger their collaboration network. However, we observe a capacity bound effect, whereby, beyond a certain point, higher performances become increasingly less correlated with large collaboration networks. We also find that international academic migrants are better at growing their networks than researchers that only migrate within the same country, but the latter seem to be better in exploiting their collaboration to achieve higher impact. High academic mobility does not appear to translate into better academic performance or larger collaboration networks. This shows a different finding with respect to related literature, where scientific productivity is seen as directly linked to mobility. Our results show that, when looking at impact of research, this is not necessarily the case. © 2021, The Author(s).",Academic mobility; Collaboration networks; Ego networks; H-index; Productivity; Science of science,Applied Network Science,Article,2021,12,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1007/s41109-021-00369-4

""Multiverse Analysis""research has shown that a lack of exploration of these decisions can lead to non-robust conclusions based on highly sensitive decision points. Importantly, even if myopic analyses are technically correct, analysts' focus on one set of decision points precludes them from exploring alternate formulations that may produce very different results. Prior work has also shown that analysts' exploration is often limited based on their training, domain, and personal experience. However, supporting analysts in exploring alternative approaches is challenging and typically requires expert feedback that is costly and hard to scale. Here, we formulate the tasks of identifying decision points and suggesting alternative analysis approaches as a classification task and a sequence-to-sequence prediction task, respectively. We leverage public collective data analysis knowledge in the form of code submissions to the popular data science platform Kaggle to build the first predictive model which supports Multiverse Analysis. Specifically, we mine this code repository for 70k small differences between 40k submissions, and demonstrate that these differences often highlight key decision points and alternative approaches in their respective analyses.We leverage information on relationships within libraries through neural graph representation learning in a multitask learning framework. We demonstrate that our model, MULTIVERSE, is able to correctly predict decision points with up to 0.81 ROC AUC, and alternative code snippets with up to 50.3% GLEU, and that it performs favorably compared to a suite of baselines and ablations. We show that when our model has perfect information about the location of decision points, say provided by the analyst, its performance increases significantly from 50.3% to 73.4% GLEU. Finally, we show through a human evaluation that real data analysts find alternatives provided by MULTIVERSE to be more reasonable, acceptable, and syntactically correct than alternatives from comparable baselines, including other transformer-based seq2seq models.  © 2021 ACM.",code representation learning; garden of forking paths; metascience; multiverse analysis; robust data science; seq2seq,Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,Conference paper,2021,1,NA,English,10.1145/3447548.3467455

Over 650 theoretical and review articles about psychological concepts in connection to sport and exercise were read in the process of creating a conceptual model that reflects the essence of SEP and leads to a conceptualization of SEP based on research topics. The result was a knowledge map of SEP made up of four main research clusters: biopsychological descriptors, external variables, psychological skills, and applied SEP practice. In terms of interdisciplinarity, the present perspective on SEP suggests that sport and exercise can be used as a research paradigm or natural laboratory to study psychological aspects relevant to various scientific fields, and that sport and exercise can be used as a therapeutic framework in response to challenges that researchers and practitioners in these fields are typically addressing. © Copyright © 2021 Latinjak and Hatzigeorgiadis.",athlete; mental skill; metascience; performance; physical activity; theory,Frontiers in Psychology,Review,2021,11,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.661824

It focuses on the concep-tual, theoretical, and methodological issues of science mapping, rather than on the mathematical formulation of science mapping techniques. After a brief history of science mapping, we describe the general procedure for building a science map, presenting the data sources and the methods to select, clean, and pre-process the data. Next, we examine in detail how the most common types of science maps, namely the citation-based and the term-based, are generated. Both are based on networks: the former on the network of publications connected by citations, the latter on the network of terms co-occurring in publications. We review the rationale behind these mapping approaches, as well as the techniques and methods to build the maps (from the extraction of the network to the visualization and enrichment of the map). We also present less-common types of science maps, including co-authorship networks, interlocking editorship networks, maps based on patents’ data, and geo-graphic maps of science. Moreover, we consider how time can be represented in science maps to investigate the dynamics of science. We also discuss some epistemological and sociological topics that can help in the interpretation, contextualization, and assessment of science maps. Then, we present some possible applications of science maps in science policy.

However, this phenomenon has received relatively little attention in science of science and scientometrics, relative to how frequently it occurs in academia. Motivated by this gap, this study seeks to identify and characterize scientists who leave the profession before the expected time in science, i.e., scientists whose productivity digresses from the normal pattern at a stage when they should be capable of publishing more papers. We first argue that simply using the termination of publishing as the sign of leaving the profession is inappropriate. Using termination of publishing as the only standard also leads to an underestimation of the overall productivity of certain types of scientists. Thus, we designed a novel measure to evaluate whether a scientist has left science. Utilizing a large-scale bibliographic dataset from Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) in the field of mathematics, we identified over 10,000 scientists who left before their 20th career year, and paired each of them with a scientist who survived for longer than 25 years.

The analysis period ran from 2016 to 2018. A qualitative approach was adopted, employing observation, documentary review and semi-structured interviews as tools for information gathering. Contributions from areas of study including science, technology and society were adopted as part of the conceptual basis. Four aspects of inquiry were employed: the socio-institutional dimension, scientific and technological research regimes, the cognitive dimension, and the social utility of scientific knowledge. The findings demonstrate a significant heterogeneity in approaches to the phenomena associated with health, indicating certain points of con-tact with regard to collective health as a Latin American tradition. © 2021, Universidad Cientifica del Sur.

The open science movement-the move toward more transparent, credible, and reproducible science-has led to a redefinition of what constitutes “normal science.” However, the field of cultural psychology, broadly construed, has by and large not engaged with the open science movement and, likewise, the open science movement has by and large not engaged with cultural psychology. The purpose of the present chapter is to bring open science and cultural psychology closer together, highlighting how they can benefit one another. In doing so, the discussion is focused on three types of representations regarding diversity in psychological research and how they intersect with open science: representation of researchers, or the diversity of the scientists actually doing the research; representation of samples, or who is included as participants in our research studies; and representation of perspectives, or the substantive conceptual and theoretical views we bring to our work. For each of these three types of representation the problem is outlined, followed by a discussion of how embracing the principles and behaviors of open science can help. © Oxford University Press 2022.",Cultural psychology; Diversity; Ethnic minority psychology; Meta-science; Open science,Cultural Methods in Psychology: Describing and Transforming Cultures,Book chapter,2021,38,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1093/oso/9780190095949.003.0015

Kokowski M.,22967895200,"Instytut Historii Nauki im. Ludwika i Aleksandra Birkenmajerów Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Warszawa – Kraków, Poland",Evaluationary (r)evolution of journals in Poland; [Ewaluacyjna (r)ewolucja czasopism w Polsce],"The article concerns the key problems of Polish ministerial lists of scientific journals, which are shown on the example of journals from the history and history of science, the idea of a new list according to the Unit for the Science of Science at the Institute for the History of Science (Polish Academy of Sciences) and the appreciation of the editorial and review activity in the Polish system of evaluation of scientific achievements. The fundamental flaw in the procedure for creating the lists of scientific journals of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Poland (December 18, 2019) and the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Poland (February 9, 2021 / February 18, 2021) is the lack of reference to the achievements of the science of science, although it was established in Poland in 1916–1939 and has been fruitfully developed in the world ever since. The bibliometric achievements of the 12 highest-scoring Polish journals from history, which received 100 points in the “List of journals of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Poland” (February 9, 2021 / February 18, 2021) were compared with the bibliometric achievements of the highest-scoring Polish journals from the sub-disciplines “history of science” or “history and philosophy of science”. Although they received only 40 points, they did not have fewer bibliometric achievements than Polish historical journals rated at 100 points. A comparison of bibliometric achievements of 18 Polish history journals indexed in Scopus showed that in 2019 and 2020, the journal Studia Historiae Scientiarum had the highest values of these indicators. On this basis, it is justified to claim that in the case of Polish journals in the discipline of “history” and sub-disciplines “history of science” and “history and philosophy of science”, the ministerial list of journals was built on the basis of non-objective and non-transparent rules. Such a critical remark also applies to the previous lists of journals of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Poland, including the list of December 18, 2019. It is therefore necessary to: a) thoroughly improve the scores of Polish journals in the sub-disciplines “history of science” and “history and philosophy of science” in the short term, because maintaining such verdicts will lead to an unjustified depreciation of scientific achievements in the field of these sub-disciplines during the evaluation of Polish academic units, and b) develop a new Polish model for evaluating journals in the long term. Bearing in mind the achievements of the integrated science of science, in particular the method of correspondence thinking and the idea of scientific (r)evolution by Michał Kokowski, praxeological research in the spirit of Tadeusz Kotarbiński, scientific communication and the trend named the responsible metrics, a new model of journal evaluation is presented. The idea of objective measures of journal’s achievements and the costs of publishing in it are described: the journal’s achievement measure (JAM)©, the journal’s cost-effectiveness measure (JCEM)© and the normalized journal’s cost-effectiveness measure (NJCEM)©. This is followed by a presentation of Rules for the creation of lists of scientific journals according to the Unit for the Science of Science at the Institute for the History of Science (Polish Academy of Sciences)©.

Gerken M.,24721165500,"University of Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, Odense M, 5230, Denmark",Public scientific testimony in the scientific image,"In this paper, I draw on philosophy of science to address a challenge for science communication. Empirical research indicates that some people who trust a meteorologist's report that they are in the path of a storm do not trust a climate scientist's report that we are on a path to global warming. Such selective skepticism about climate science exemplifies a more general challenge: The Challenge of Selective Uptake Laypersons who generally accept public scientific testimony nevertheless fail to accept public scientific testimony concerning select, equally well warranted, scientific hypotheses. A prominent response arising from the novel interdisciplinary science of science communication is a principle called Consensus Reporting. According to this principle, science reporters should, whenever feasible, report the scientific consensus or lack thereof for a reported scientific view. However, philosophy of science may offer a different perspective on the issue. This perspective is critical insofar as it indicates some inadequacies of Consensus Reporting. But it is also constructive insofar as it guides the development of an alternative principle, Justification Reporting, according to which science reporters should, whenever feasible, report aspects of the nature and strength of scientific justification or lack thereof for a reported scientific view. A central difference between these proposals is that Consensus Reporting appeals to the authority of the scientists whereas Justification Reporting appeals to the authority of scientific justification. As such, Justification Reporting reflects the image of science. The paper considers the philosophical and empirical motivation for Justification Reporting and its limitations. This includes prospects and problems for implementing it in a way that addresses The Challenge of Selective Uptake. From a methodological point of view, the paper illustrates how empirically informed philosophy of science may help address challenges for science communication. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",NA,Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A,Article,2020,8,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.shpsa.2019.05.006

Expert procedures, like codes of conduct and court-appointed experts, remain controversial among academics and courts. Much of this discussion, however, has been divorced from the science of the reforms. In this article, the authors draw from emerging work in behavioural ethics and metascience that studies procedures analogous to those that are being used in courts. This work suggests that procedures can be effective, as they have been in science, if directed at key vulnerabilities in the research and reporting process. The authors’ analysis of the metascience and behavioural ethics literature also suggests several nuances in how expert evidence procedure ought to be designed and employed. For instance, codes of conduct require specific and direct wording that experts cannot interpret as ethically permissive. Further, drawing on a recent case study, courts have an important role to play in establishing a culture that takes codes as serious ethical responsibilities, and not simply as pro forma requirements. © 2020 Sydney Law Review and authors.",NA,Sydney Law Review,Article,2020,6,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.31228/osf.io/t954x

Researchers' satisfaction with the publication system and a proposal for radical change,"In this preregistered study we evaluate current attitudes towards, and experiences with, publishing research and propose an alternative system of publishing. Our main hypothesis is that researchers tend to become institutionalized, such that they are generally discontent with the current publication system, but that this dissatisfaction fades over time as they become tenured. A survey was distributed to the first authors of papers published in four recent issues of top-15 Work and Organizational Psychology (WOP) journals. Even among this positively biased sample, we found that the time it takes to publish a manuscript is negatively associated with whether authors perceive this time to be justifiable and worthwhile relative to the amount their manuscript has changed. Review quality and tenure buffer the negative relationship with perceived justifiability, but not for perceived worth. The findings suggest that untenured (WOP) researchers are dissatisfied with the publishing times of academic journals, which adds to the pile of criticisms of the journalbased publication system. Since publishing times are inherent to the journal-based publication system, we suggest that incremental improvements may not sufficiently address the problems associated with publishing times. We therefore propose the adoption of a modular publication system to improve (WOP) publishing experiences. © 2020 by the authors.",Meta-science; Publication system; Publishing times; Satisfaction,Publications,Article,2020,2,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.3390/publications8010014

For him, epistemology, more than a discursive meta-science, is a practice (conscious or not) for every sociologist who exerts the office of scientific research, and his very scientific legacy evidences it. Hence, his “reflexive sociology” is nothing more than a practical epistemology that allows at the same time the most varied construction of scientific objects with the support of a theoretical capital amassed throughout his intellectual career in the formula [(habitus) (capital)] + field = practice whose openly addressed concepts allow it. Just as it can be learned theoretical and methodological lessons, this article presents two direct lessons from the work of the French sociologist, one epistemological and another about the construction of the object of study, and an indirect one in the conclusions about the advantages of being faced with an open and unfinished proposal like Pierre Bourdieu's for scientific research. © 2020 Universidad de Chile, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales.

Kuznetsova N.I.,57195545454,NA,The Embers of Memory,"This article, for which the focus is an intellectual autobiography, examines the development of worldview of a young person who graduated from the Moscow University Faculty of Philosophy in 1970. It highlights the main socially significant events of those times, events that determined the formation of the sociopolitical views of youth who did not accept Soviet ideology. It presents the reading circles and interactions of that period and tells of the outstanding Russian philosophers of the 1960s–1970s under whose influence this professional development took place. It considers the main topics of the key scholarship in philosophy, as well as the dynamics of research interests and problems. Particular attention is paid to the story of the originality of work by the Moscow Methodological Circle, led by Georgy P. Shchedrovitsky. The circle’s main task was to put all acts of reasoning and mental operations—naming, defining, describing, building ontological models and theoretical constructions, and so forth—under reflexive control. This was, to some extent, reminiscent of the inquiries of Western analytical philosophy, which made it a “suspicious” activity in the ideological sense in the Soviet Union. Cognition as a whole no longer seemed a “reflection” of reality, as had been proclaimed in the leading epistemological understanding of Marxist–Leninist philosophy. However, this also reflected the desire of intellectuals of the sixties and seventies to rationalize all social life as a whole. These dreams of “rationality” manifested at the time in the development of relevant topics in disciplines such as epistemology, in philosophy and methodology of science, and in sociological and psychological research. The author tells how the discussions of methodological problems of historical reconstruction began from positions like these. The discussion of discourse on knowledge in the humanities required not only intellectual audacity but social audacity as well. These discussions took place in informal, home-based seminars and represented a marginal, “clandestine” phenomenon. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",epistemology; historical process; historical reconstruction; Moscow Methodological Circle; philosophical education; philosophical generation; philosophy of science; reflexivity; science of science,Russian Studies in Philosophy,Article,2021,0,NA,English,10.1080/10611967.2021.2010473

As a consequence, researchers have to specialize in narrow subdisciplines, which makes it challenging to uncover scientific connections beyond the own field of research. Thus, access to structured knowledge from a large corpus of publications could help push the frontiers of science. Here, we demonstrate a method to build a semantic network from published scientific literature, which we call SEMNET. We use SEMNET to predict future trends in research and to inspire personalized and surprising seeds of ideas in science. We apply it in the discipline of quantum physics, which has seen an unprecedented growth of activity in recent years. In SEMNET, scientific knowledge is represented as an evolving network using the content of 750,000 scientific papers published since 1919. The nodes of the network correspond to physical concepts, and links between two nodes are drawn when two concepts are concurrently studied in research articles. We identify influential and prize-winning research topics from the past inside SEMNET, thus confirming that it stores useful semantic knowledge. We train a neural network using states of SEMNET of the past to predict future developments in quantum physics and confirm high-quality predictions using historic data. Using network theoretical tools, we can suggest personalized, out-of-the-box ideas by identifying pairs of concepts, which have unique and extremal semantic network properties.

Experts showed susceptibility to all three biases, and susceptibility was not influenced by years of science practice.

Percentages of editors and consulting editors at American institutions also decreased significantly; however, the effect for consulting editors was also quadratic—the linear decline accelerated over time. Predicted mean percentages of American consulting editors at 10-year intervals (1980–2020) were 94%, 92%, 89%, 80%, and 69%. Our 2020 predicted mean of 69% American consulting editors was notably lower than Thalmayer et al.’s (2020) 2018 mean of 82%. In addition, higher-impact journals had more pronounced quadratic declines in the percentages of American consulting editors over time.

In the current article, we queried more than 26,000 empirical articles published between 1974 and 2018 in top-tier cognitive, developmental, and social psychology journals to document how often psychological research acknowledges this reality and to examine whether people who edit, write, and participate in the research are systematically connected. We note several findings. First, across the past five decades, psychological publications that highlight race have been rare, and although they have increased in developmental and social psychology, they have remained virtually nonexistent in cognitive psychology. Second, most publications have been edited by White editors, under which there have been significantly fewer publications that highlight race. Third, many of the publications that highlight race have been written by White authors who employed significantly fewer participants of color. In many cases, we document variation as a function of area and decade. We argue that systemic inequality exists within psychological research and that systemic changes are needed to ensure that psychological research benefits from diversity in editing, writing, and participation. To this end, and in the spirit of the field’s recent emphasis on metascience, we offer recommendations for journals and authors. © The Author(s) 2020.",metascience; race; review; systemic inequality,Perspectives on Psychological Science,Article,2020,750,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,English,10.1177/1745691620927709

Synergetics is chosen as the methodological basis of research. The aim of the study is to develop a synergistic concept of the emergence of statistical laws of information processes and phenomena in scientific communications for their generalization and presentation in the form of a single law. The concept of synergetics is developed for scientific communications as a manifestation of objectively existing but theoretically unsubstantiated quantitative relations between the subjects and objects of these communications (scientists, publications, and terms). The necessity of using stable distribution laws of probability theory for describing scale-invariant phenomena and processes is noted. In the mathematical sense, the stability of the distribution law is the property of preserving its type for any sum of random variables having this distribution. The mathematical abstraction of a ‘random variable’ in scientific communications takes on a clear concreteness. For Bradford’s regularity, the random variable is the number of articles on a particular topic in the journal; for Lotka’s regularity, it is the number of scholar’s publications; and for Zipf’s regularity, it is the frequency of using the word in the text. The study has determined the characteristic indicator of the stable law of the distribution of processes and phenomena in scientific communications, which is equal to the constant of the golden section. A synergistic concept of scientific communications is formulated as follows: scale-invariant processes and phenomena of self-organization are a manifestation of a stable distribution law of probability theory with a characteristic indicator equal to the constant of the golden ratio",large-scale invariance; librarianship; stable distribution; statistical laws,Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies,Article,2020,0,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.15587/1729-4061.2020.194474

We find that IFs are highly volatile. For example, the top-cited paper of 381 journals caused their IF to increase by more than 0.5 points, while for 818 journals the relative increase exceeded 25%. One in 10 journals had their IF boosted by more than 50% by their top three cited papers. Because the single-paper effect on the IF is inversely proportional to journal size, small journals are rewarded much more strongly than large journals for a highly cited paper, while they are penalized more for a low-cited paper, especially if their IF is high. This skewed reward mechanism incentivizes high-IF journals to stay small to remain competitive in rankings. We discuss the implications for breakthrough papers appearing in prestigious journals.

One main source of complexity arises from the collaboration between actors, and network science methodologies can be leveraged to explore that complexity. We aim to characterize collaborations between actors in the clinical trials context and investigate trends of successful actors. Materials and Methods: We constructed a temporal network of clinical trial collaborations between large and small-size pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, hospital systems, and government agencies from public and proprietary data and introduced metrics to quantify actors' collaboration network structure, organizational behavior, and partnership characteristics. A multivariable regression analysis was conducted to determine the metrics' relationship with success. Results: We found a positive correlation between the number of successful approved trials and interdisciplinary collaborations measured by a collaboration diversity metric (P <. 01). Our results also showed a negative effect of the local clustering coefficient (P <. 01) on the success of clinical trials. Large pharmaceutical companies have the lowest local clustering coefficient and more diversity in partnerships across biomedical specializations. Conclusions: Large pharmaceutical companies are more likely to collaborate with a wider range of actors from other specialties, especially smaller industry actors who are newcomers in clinical research, resulting in exclusive access to smaller actors. Future investigations are needed to show how concentrations of influence and resources might result in diminished gains in treatment development. © 2020 The Author(s).",clinical research; collaboration network; complex system; network science; science of science,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,Article,2021,2,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1093/jamia/ocaa243

And yet, it has often been viewed as a special-interest area producing less rigorous work than other subfields. Such unduly negative perceptions may undermine the extent to which developments in gender-related scholarship ultimately contribute to broader scientific and social advances. The current work seeks to address common misconceptions about the psychology of gender, both by highlighting impactful contributions from existing work and identifying opportunities for further research. To do so, it discusses three specific misconceptions that may distort the assessment (and ultimately limit the impact) of work in this field.

Answering this question requires careful consideration of the various approaches to achieve the collective goal of self-correction. One of the most straightforward mechanisms is individual self-correction: researchers rectifying their own mistakes by publishing a correction notice. Although it offers an efficient route to correcting the scientific record, it has received little to no attention from a metascientific point of view. We aim to fill this void by analysing the content of correction notices published from 2010 until 2018 in the three psychology journals featuring the highest number of corrections over that timespan based on the Scopus database (i.e. Psychological Science with N = 58, Frontiers in Psychology with N = 99 and Journal of Affective Disorders with N = 57). More concretely, we examined which aspects of the original papers were affected (e.g. hypotheses, data-analyses, metadata such as author order, affiliations, funding information etc.) as well as the perceived implications for the papers' main findings. Our exploratory analyses showed that many corrections involved inconsequential errors. Furthermore, authors rarely revised their conclusions, even though several corrections concerned changes to the results.

All references from 641 articles, published from 1948 to 2017, are used to analyze a citation network. The analysis visualizes and identifies prominent articles in the scientific debate and locates them structurally on a map. Each article is categorized in terms of the school of thought, its position within the discourse (e.g., opposing, supporting), the order of intentionality (e.g., 1st or 2nd order), and the species under consideration. By using a mixed-methods approach, which combines qualitative and quantitative methods, we identified 2 divergent schools of thought (psychological/philosophical and biological/behavioristic). Both schools introduced intention mostly independently from each other and show little overlap in citation habits. Both notions of intention have influenced comparative science until today. However, although the term finds limited application in various schools, only in connection with more cognitive approaches has it enjoyed a successful career, as indicated by the increasing number of articles in which it is used. Most controversy does not surround the concept of intention itself but its order. Furthermore, taking account of which species are investigated could reveal a pronounced primate bias in past discourse. Articles on nonprimate species using the term intention in the cognitive sense are markedly outnumbered by those on primates. The study reminds comparative psychologists of the importance to integrate a historical perspective into current debates, to avoid ""speciesism"" and talking past each other. © 2019 American Psychological Association.",Behaviorism; Cognition; Intention; Metascience; Primate,Journal of Comparative Psychology,Article,2020,3,NA,English,10.1037/com0000191

The field of metascience—the use of scientific methodology to study science itself—has examined various aspects of this robustness requirement for research that uses conventional designed studies (e.g., surveys, laboratory experiments) to collect data. Largely missing, however, are efforts to examine the robustness of empirical research using “organic data,” namely, data that are generated without any explicit research design elements and are continuously documented by digital devices (e.g., video captured by ubiquitous sensing devices; content and social interactions extracted from social networking sites, Twitter feeds, and click streams). Given the growing popularity of using organic data in management research, it is essential to understand issues concerning the usage and processing of organic data that may affect the robustness of research findings.

Obermeister N.,57192652762,"University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom",Tapping into science advisers’ learning,"The art and craft of science advice is not innately known by those scientists who choose to step out of the lab or the university to engage with the world of policy. Despite a wealth of literature on the ‘science of science advice’, in nearly every situation there is no ‘teacher’ of science advice; it is a typical case of learning on the job. Within that context, the learning of scholars engaging in expert advice is always situated and can sometimes be transformative. To date, however, there has been no systematic, in-depth research into expert advisers’ learning—instead focusing mostly on policymakers’ and publics’ learning about science. In this article, I suggest that such a research programme is timely and potentially a very fruitful line of inquiry for two mains reasons. First, in the case of environmental and climate issues—the focus of the paper—it has become ubiquitous to talk about the need for transformative change(s) towards sustainable futures. If scholars are going to advocate for and inform transformations beyond academia, then in doing so they ought to also take a harder look at how they themselves are transforming within. Specifically, the article illustrates how qualitative research on advisers’ learning can contribute to our understanding of how experts are adapting to changing circumstances in science–policy interactions. Second, it is argued that research on advisers’ learning can directly contribute to: (i) guidance for present and future advisers (especially early-career researchers wishing to engage with policy) and organisational learning in science–policy organisations; and (ii) improving policy-relevance of research and the design of impact evaluations for research funding (e.g. Research Excellence Framework). With the hope of stimulating (rather than closing off) innovative ideas, the article offers some ways of thinking through and carrying out such a research programme.

Since the number of scholars and the number of scholarly outputs grow exponentially with time, well-designed ranking metrics that have the potential to assist in these tasks are of prime importance. To rank scholars, it is important to put their achievements in perspective by comparing them with the achievements of other scholars active in the same period. We propose here a particular way of doing so: by computing the evaluated scholar's share on each year's citations which quantifies how the scholar fares in competition with the others. We assess the resulting ranking method using the American Physical Society citation data and four prestigious physics awards. Our results show that the new method significantly outperforms other ranking methods in identifying the prize laureates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.",Nobel Prize; Scholar evaluation; Time bias,Journal of Informetrics,Article,2020,14,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.joi.2020.101038

A narrative review and exploratory study of four international research funding and administrative organisations,"Background: Public research funding agencies and research organisations are increasingly accountable for the wider impacts of the research they support. While research impact assessment (RIA) frameworks and tools exist, little is known and shared of how these organisations implement RIA activities in practice. Methods: We conducted a review of academic literature to search for research organisations' published experiences of RIAs. We followed this with semi-structured interviews from a convenience sample (n = 7) of representatives of four research organisations deploying strategies to support and assess research impact. Results: We found only five studies reporting empirical evidence on how research organisations put RIA principles into practice. From our interviews, we observed a disconnect between published RIA frameworks and tools, and the realities of organisational practices, which tended not to be reported. We observed varying maturity and readiness with respect to organisations' structural set ups for conducting RIAs, particularly relating to leadership, skills for evaluation and automating RIA data collection. Key processes for RIA included efforts to engage researcher communities to articulate and plan for impact, using a diversity of methods, frameworks and indicators, and supporting a learning approach. We observed outcomes of RIAs as having supported a dialogue to orient research to impact, underpinned shared learning from analyses of research, and provided evidence of the value of research in different domains and to different audiences. Conclusions: Putting RIA principles and frameworks into practice is still in early stages for research organisations. We recommend that organisations (1) get set up by considering upfront the resources, time and leadership required to embed impact strategies throughout the organisation and wider research 'ecosystem', and develop methodical approaches to assessing impact; (2) work together by engaging researcher communities and wider stakeholders as a core part of impact pathway planning and subsequent assessment; and (3) recognise the benefits that RIA can bring about as a means to improve mutual understanding of the research process between different actors with an interest in research. © 2020 The Author(s).",Impact; research assessment; research evaluation; research funders; research funding organisations; research impact assessment; RIA; science of science,Health Research Policy and Systems,Article,2020,17,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1186/s12961-019-0515-1

And for a good reason: New forms and unseen quantities of data enter nearly every scientific field, substantially changing the ways how scientists do science, and potentially allowing them to answer old questions or to pose them in novel ways. The recent success of Data Science is also reflected in corresponding study programs and curricula and the emergence of specialized branches, such as Geographic Data Science (GDS). Some researchers, therefore, claim that Data Science and GDS should be treated as autonomous scientific disciplines, while others fear that it sells nothing but old wine in new bottles. In an attempt to sober the discussion, we investigate GDS and Data Science from the perspective of meta-science. We provide arguments why today's GDS and Data Science should be seen as an interdisciplinary community of practice of data-driven scientists, rather than a scientific discipline. We also discuss what is missing for GDS and Data Science to become genuine scientific disciplines. © 2020 The Authors.

Thus, a biased scientific record is of questionable value because it impedes scientific progress, and the public receives advice on the basis of unreliable evidence that has the potential to have far-reaching detrimental consequences. Meta-analysis is a technique that can be used to summarize research evidence. However, meta-analytic effect size estimates may themselves be biased, threatening the validity and usefulness of meta-analyses to promote scientific progress. Here, we offer a large-scale simulation study to elucidate how p-hacking and publication bias distort metaanalytic effect size estimates under a broad array of circumstances that reflect the reality that exists across a variety of research areas. The results revealed that, first, very high levels of publication bias can severely distort the cumulative evidence. Second, p-hacking and publication bias interact: At relatively high and low levels of publication bias, p-hacking does comparatively little harm, but at medium levels of publication bias, p-hacking can considerably contribute to bias, especially when the true effects are very small or are approaching zero. Third, p-hacking can severely increase the rate of false positives. A key implication is that, in addition to preventing p-hacking, policies in research institutions, funding agencies, and scientific journals need to make the prevention of publication bias a top priority to ensure a trustworthy base of evidence. © 2020 American Psychological Association.",Meta-analysis; Metascience; P-hacking; Publication bias,Psychological Methods,Article,2020,82,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1037/met0000246

Protopopova I.,56786508500,NA,PLATO and HUSSERL. ARTICLE REVIEW:; [Платон и Гуссерль. Рецензия на статью:],"Alan Kim’s article considers Husserl’s specific phenomenological Platonism, a rather innovative area of the comparative history of philosophy, not least due to Husserl’s own criticism of “naive Platonism” that interprets Plato in the spirit of “metaphysical dualism”. Still, Kim with good reason juxtaposes Husserl and Plato, since Husserl’s own reading of Plato is quite different, and he even calls himself a Platonist. He attributes to Plato the ideal of metascience and, considering phenomenology as such, believes that Plato’s theory of forms implements this ideal. Kim shows how Husserl’s phenomenological Platonism manifests itself in the 1907 course of lectures Ding und Raum and in the book Erfahrung und Urteil, published in 1939. An impressive similarity is demonstrated when comparing the phenomenological method with the anamnesis from the Phaedo and the myth of the Сave from the Republic. Both Husserl and Plato enclose the natural attitude in brackets and ascend to the world of eidē as a priori conditions of consciousness. Eidos reveals itself as a model, in relation to which all its sensual incarnations look defective, i.e. just shadows. In conclusion, Kim identifies Husserl’s key understanding of eidē as rules (Wesensgesetze). More precisely, eidos is the (only) universal rule, F, for creating an indefinite set of specific indivi-dual f’s, whether empirical or imaginary. Thus, Husserl’s “Platonism” operates with a functional interpretation of eidos, and this is a kind of genetic idealism associated with Lotze and the neo-Kantian Natorp. For all three of them — Lotze, Natorp, and Husserl — Plato was not a Platonist in the usual metaphysical sense, and Husserl has read him as a transcendental phenomenologist.

If these studies use methods that are unfaithful to the original study or ineffective in eliciting the phenomenon of interest, then a failure to replicate may be a failure of the protocol rather than a challenge to the original finding. Formal pre-data-collection peer review by experts may address shortcomings and increase replicability rates. We selected 10 replication studies from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (RP:P; Open Science Collaboration, 2015) for which the original authors had expressed concerns about the replication designs before data collection; only one of these studies had yielded a statistically significant effect (p <.05). Commenters suggested that lack of adherence to expert review and low-powered tests were the reasons that most of these RP:P studies failed to replicate the original effects. We revised the replication protocols and received formal peer review prior to conducting new replication studies. We administered the RP:P and revised protocols in multiple laboratories (median number of laboratories per original study = 6.5, range = 3–9; median total sample = 1,279.5, range = 276–3,512) for high-powered tests of each original finding with both protocols. Overall, following the preregistered analysis plan, we found that the revised protocols produced effect sizes similar to those of the RP:P protocols (Δr =.002 or.014, depending on analytic approach). The median effect size for the revised protocols (r =.05) was similar to that of the RP:P protocols (r =.04) and the original RP:P replications (r =.11), and smaller than that of the original studies (r =.37). Analysis of the cumulative evidence across the original studies and the corresponding three replication attempts provided very precise estimates of the 10 tested effects and indicated that their effect sizes (median r =.07, range =.00–.15) were 78% smaller, on average, than the original effect sizes (median r =.37, range =.19–.50). © The Author(s) 2020.",metascience; open data; peer review; preregistered; Registered Reports; replication; reproducibility,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,Article,2020,60,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1177/2515245920958687

We marshaled genealogical data on nearly 40,000 scientists who published 1,167,518 papers in biomedicine, chemistry, math, or physics between 1960 and 2017 to investigate the relationship between mentorship and protégé achievement. In our data, we find groupings of mentors with similar records and reputations who attracted protégés of similar talents and expected levels of professional success. However, each grouping has an exception: One mentor has an additional hidden capability that can be mentored to their protégés. They display skill in creating and communicating prizewinning research. Because the mentor's ability for creating and communicating celebrated research existed before the prize's conferment, protégés of future prizewinning mentors can be uniquely exposed to mentorship for conducting celebrated research. Our models explain 34-44% of the variance in protégé success and reveals three main findings. First, mentorship strongly predicts protégé success across diverse disciplines. Mentorship is associated with a 2×-to- 4× rise in a protégé's likelihood of prizewinning, National Academy of Science (NAS) induction, or superstardom relative to matched protégés. Second, mentorship is significantly associated with an increase in the probability of protégés pioneering their own research topics and being midcareer late bloomers. Third, contrary to conventional thought, protégés do not succeed most by following their mentors' research topics but by studying original topics and coauthoring no more than a small fraction of papers with their mentors. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

The increasing availability of digital data on scholarly outputs offers unprecedented opportunities to explore science of science (SciSci). Despite many significant works have been done on SciSci, substantial disciplinary differences in different domains make some insights inadequate within particular fields. One thing standing out is that knowledge concerning the science behind AI is sorely lacking. In this work, we study the evolution of AI from three dimensions, including the evolution of trend, mobility, and collaboration. We find that the AI research hotspots have shifted from theory to application. The USA, which has the largest number of distinguished AI scientists, appeals most to the global AI talents. The brain drain problem of AI scientists is increasingly serious in developing countries. The ties among the AI elites are highly clustered in the collaboration network.

But what does this bode for the convergence of global culture? Here we explore the relationship between centralization in social networks and contraction or collapse in the diversity of semantic expressions such as ideas, opinions and tastes. We advance formal examination of this relationship by introducing new methods of manifold learning that allow us to map social networks and semantic combinations into comparable hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic representations natively represent both hierarchy and diversity within a system. In a Poincaré disk—a two-dimensional hyperbolic embedding—radius from center traces the position of an actor in a social hierarchy or an idea in a semantic hierarchy. Angle of the disk required to inscribe connected actors or ideas captures their diversity. We illustrate this method by examining the relationship between social centralization and semantic diversity within 21st Century physics, empirically demonstrating how dense, centralized collaboration is associated with a reduction in the space of ideas and how these patterns generalize to all modern scholarship and science. We discuss the complex of causes underlying this association, and theorize the dynamic interplay between structural centralization and semantic contraction, arguing that it introduces an essential tension between the supply and demand of difference. © 2019",Auto-encoders; Hyperbolic embedding; Machine learning; Poincaré disk; Science of science; Semantic networks; Social networks; Unsupervised learning,Poetics,Article,2020,7,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.poetic.2019.101428

Like any other research topic, NoC inevitably goes through its life cycle: A. it started up (2000-2007) and quickly gained traction in its own right; B. it then entered the phase of growth and shakeout (2008-2013) with the research outcomes peaked in 2010 and remained high for another four/five years; C. NoC research was considered mature and stable (2014-2020), with signs showing a steady slowdown. Although from time to time, excellent survey articles on different subjects/aspects of NoC appeared in the open literature, yet there is no general consensus on where we are in this NoC roadmap and where we are heading, largely due to lack of an overarching methodology and tool to assess and quantify the research outcomes and evolution. In this paper, we address this issue from the perspective of three specific complex networks, namely the citation network, the subject citation network, and the co-authorship network. The network structure parameters (e.g., modularity, diameter, etc.) and graph dynamics of the three networks are extracted and analyzed, which helps reveal and explain the reasons and the driving forces behind all the changes observed in NoC research over 20 years. Additional analyses are performed in this study to link interesting phenomena surrounding the NoC area. They include: (1) relationships between communities in citation networks and NoC subjects, (2) measure and visualization of a subject's influence score and its evolution, (3) knowledge flow among the six most popular NoC subjects and their relationships, (4) evolution of various subjects in terms of number of publications, (5) collaboration patterns and cross-community collaboration among the authors in NoC research, (6) interesting observation of career lifetime and productivity among NoC researchers, and finally (7) investigation of whether or not new authors are chasing hot subjects in NoC. All these analyses have led to a prediction of publications, subjects, and co-authorship in NoC research in the near future, which is also presented in the paper. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The scale of the data is especially valuable for the study of science, which is characterized by a high level of stratification and segmentation. In turn, the techniques of network and computational text analysis have influenced how research questions were proposed. These new tools declare far-reaching implications for the science of science because researchers have the possibility to employ a flexible approach and refuse to rely on pre-defined categories, as was common for previous studies in the sociology of science.

This article seeks to answer recent questions about growth mindset, such as: Does a growth mindset predict student outcomes? Do growth mindset interventions work, and work reliably? Are the effect sizes meaningful enough to merit attention? And can teachers successfully instill a growth mindset in students? After exploring the important lessons learned from these questions, the article concludes that large-scale studies, including preregistered replications and studies conducted by third parties (such as international governmental agencies), justify confidence in growth mindset research. Mindset effects, however, are meaningfully heterogeneous across individuals and contexts. The article describes three recent advances that have helped the field to learn from this heterogeneity: standardized measures and interventions, studies designed specifically to identify where growth mindset interventions do not work (and why), and a conceptual framework for anticipating and interpreting moderation effects. The next generation of mindset research can build on these advances, for example by beginning to understand and perhaps change classroom contexts in ways that can make interventions more effective.

This article presents an evidence of academic literature on risk as an approach to regulatory governance. It follows the logic and applies tools of meta-research, a systematic and replicable process of synthesizing research findings across a body of original research.

The article presents the main findings from the evidence synthesis, presents the gaps in our knowledge, and suggests a future agenda for research on risk as an approach to regulatory governance. The article finds that despite ongoing conceptual and normative debates about the need for risk governance and risk-based regulation, we lack a good understanding of how it operates in practice.

Here, we offer a comprehensive picture of longitudinal gender differences in performance through a bibliometric analysis of academic publishing careers by reconstructing the complete publication history of over 1.5 million gender-identified authors whose publishing career ended between 1955 and 2010, covering 83 countries and 13 disciplines. We find that, paradoxically, the increase of participation of women in science over the past 60 years was accompanied by an increase of gender differences in both productivity and impact. Most surprisingly, though, we uncover two gender invariants, finding that men and women publish at a comparable annual rate and have equivalent career-wise impact for the same size body of work. Finally, we demonstrate that differences in publishing career lengths and dropout rates explain a large portion of the reported career-wise differences in productivity and impact, although productivity differences still remain.

Furthermore, we highlight how the topics have evolved through analysis of publication dates and also use author information to clarify the topics’ content. The results obtained have been reviewed and approved by 3 leading experts in this field and interestingly show that Chinese Science of Science has gradually become mature in the last 40 years, evolving from the general nature of the discipline itself to related disciplines and their potential interactions, from qualitative analysis to quantitative and visual analysis, and from general research on the social function of science to its more specific economic function and strategic function studies. Consequently, the proposed novel method can be used without supervision, parameters and help from any external knowledge to obtain very clear and precise insights about the development of a scientific domain. The output of the topic extraction part of the method (clustering + feature maximization) is finally compared with the output of the well-known LDA approach by experts in the domain which serves to highlight the very clear superiority of the proposed approach. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",China; Diachronic analysis; Feature maximization; Science of Science; Topic tracking; Unsupervised learning; World,Scientometrics,Article,2020,8,NA,English,10.1007/s11192-020-03503-8

In this article, we aim to understand the width by establishing our empirical study on a previously built structure, namely ego-centered citation networks (ECCNs). We remove the direct links to the focal publication and only retain the other edges in the network. Particularly, we examine the number and the size of the connected components of sub-networks of ECCNs in the whole Web of Science database. We find that the number and size of the connected components increase as the number of citations of publications rises, regardless of discipline, and that they are greater in recent publications than in older ones. We also observe that there are some differences in terms of the number/size of the connected components; particularly, the number/size of connected components for publications in Arts and Humanities is more “special” compared with other disciplines, and Natural Sciences tends to have greater values. These details are indicative in terms of the specializations of academia. Moreover, the findings have far-reaching implications on research assessment practices and literature searching. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Citation analysis; Citation impact; Science of science; Scientific impact; Scientometrics,Information Processing and Management,Article,2021,15,NA,English,10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102429

As such, cultural evolution is highly relevant for the emerging “science of science communication” (SSC) in that it can help organize and guide the study of science communication efforts aimed at spreading scientifically accurate information and inspiring behavioral change. Here, I synthesize insights and theory from cultural evolution with central findings and concepts within the SSC with the aim of highlighting the inherent, but underexplored, consilience between these two fields. I demonstrate how cultural evolution can serve as an unifying framework for the SSC and how, conversely, science communication can serve as a fertile testing ground for applying, exploring, and advancing cultural evolutionary theory in a real-world setting that matters. Lastly, I highlight merits and limitations of previous applications of cultural evolution to science communication and conclude with some particularly outstanding questions that emerge at the intersection between cultural evolution and science communication research. © 2020, The Author(s).",NA,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,Article,2020,6,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1057/s41599-020-00634-4

We investigate how improved data access shifts the quantity, quality, and diversity of scientific research. We examine the impact of reductions in cost and sharing restrictions for satellite imagery data from NASA's Landsat program (the longest record of remote-sensing observations of the Earth) on academic science using a sample of about 24,000 Landsat publications by over 34,000 authors matched to almost 3,000 unique study locations. Analyses show that improved access had a substantial and positive effect on the quantity and quality of Landsat-enabled science. Improved data access also democratizes science by disproportionately helping scientists from the developing world and lower-ranked institutions to publish using Landsat data. This democratization in turn increases the geographic and topical diversity of Landsat-enabled research. Scientists who start using Landsat data after access is improved tend to focus on previously understudied regions close to their home location and introduce novel research topics. These findings suggest that policies that improve access to valuable scientific data may promote scientific progress, reduce inequality among scientists, and increase the diversity of scientific research. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Tribalism is not inherently bad, but it can lead to ideological thinking and sacred values that distort cognitive processing of putatively objective information in ways that affirm and strengthen the views and well-being of one’s ingroup (and that increase one’s own standing within one’s ingroup). Because of this shared evolutionary history of intergroup conflict, liberals and conservatives likely share the same underlying tribal psychology, which creates the potential for ideologically distorted information processing. Over the past several decades, social scientists have sedulously documented various tribal and ideological psychological tendencies on the political right, and more recent work has documented similar tendencies on the political left. We contend that these tribal tendencies and propensities can lead to ideologically distorted information processing in any group. And this ideological epistemology can become especially problematic for the pursuit of the truth when groups are ideologically homogenous and hold sacred values that might be contradicted by empirical inquiry. Evidence suggests that these conditions might hold for modern social science; therefore, we conclude by exploring potential ideologically driven distortions in the social sciences. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Cognitive bias; equalitarianism; evolution; intergroup conflict; metascience; motivated reasoning; politics; social science; tribalism,Psychological Inquiry,Article,2020,83,NA,English,10.1080/1047840X.2020.1721233

Discovering important knowledge has become difficult even for researchers in specific domains. Previously proposed keyphrase extraction methods focus mainly on detecting intensively discussed topics in specific domains but do not distinguish concepts with the interdisciplinary spread from those discussed in narrow areas. Here, we propose a diffusion meme score that evaluates the knowledge diffusion distance in a paper citation network. The distance between papers that contain specific terms is measured by the network embedding space of the citation network. Using 57 million publication records from 48 years of Scopus, we evaluated newly appearing terms in and after 1975 in biomedical science papers using the proposed indicator. Approximately half of the top 20 terms were related to Nobel Prize or Clarivate Citation Laureates, and the top terms of the indicators were more likely to appear in Wikipedia than terms extracted using existing methods. Moreover, the top terms were unlikely to include specific minor diseases, which are often extracted using existing methods. Therefore, the diffusion meme score evaluates important terms from scientific literature and citation networks that are more interdisciplinary. Our method improves the understanding of young researchers regarding domains, the development of the history of science, and the evaluation of researcher contributions.  © 2013 IEEE.",Citation network; interdisciplinary research; knowledge discovery; science of science,IEEE Access,Article,2021,2,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3110111

This study presents general methods to study the evolution of a biomedical organization and its impact over time. Methods are illustrated in a case study that aims to capture the “Then and Now” science of the North American Vascular Biology Organization (NAVBO). Publications authored by the founding members who came together to create NAVBO in 1994 are compared with publications by those representing the society 25 years later. Google Scholar data was compiled for NAVBO members registered in 1994 (n = 70) and in 2019 (n = 465), some members being present in both data sets (n = 22). The 501 unique NAVBO members had more than 76,000 papers cited over 4,400,000 times. Several characteristics associated with the NAVBO members’ output were revealed, including their high productivity, the high impact of their publications, and the predominant contribution of relatively small laboratories, as suggested by a low average number of authors per publication. To understand how NAVBO fostered scientific collaborations and exchanges of expertize, data was analyzed and visualized to show the evolution of member co-author networks. The UCSD Map of Science was used to communicate the evolution of scientific topics covered by NAVBO members helping to create a global picture of NAVBO’s science “then and now.” All workflows are available online in case other scholarly organizations would want to use them to map their own evolution and impact; and meta studies that communicate the inner workings of these important scholarly efforts can be conducted.

Consequently, a natural and obvious conjecture is that measurement science is the science of sciences. In fact, it is a basis of all experimental and theoretical research activities. Each measuring process assumes an object of measurement. Some science disciplines, such as quantum physics, are still incomprehensible despite complex mathematical interpretations. No phenomenon is a real phenomenon unless it is observable in space and time, that is, unless it is a subject to measurement. The science of measurement is an indispensable ingredient in all scientific fields.

We find that, although Nobel laureates were energetic producers from the outset, producing works that garner unusually high impact, their careers before winning the prize follow relatively similar patterns to those of ordinary scientists, being characterized by hot streaks and increasing reliance on collaborations. We also uncovered notable variations along their careers, often associated with the Nobel Prize, including shifting coauthorship structure in the prize-winning work, and a significant but temporary dip in the impact of work they produce after winning the Nobel Prize.

Instead, Adolf Reinach in The Apriori Foundations of the Civil Law defines the notion of norm as polysemantic and distinguishes the legal provisions (the prescriptive sentences), formulated within a given community, from the basic norms which are grounded in the objective (including moral) justness of the states of affairs. The obligation of the being and the obligation of acting exist in themselves, independently from cognition. In turn, “enactments and the propositions which express enactments” as a kind of normative sentences have the character of normalisation, but they require a person to pronounce them. The prescriptions realise and refer to what is objectively being and to the objectivity of what is being and obligatory.

We deal with a didactical characterization of the nature of the scientific enterprise that conceptualizes science-in-the-making from a perspective that resorts to the idea of evidence. From this point of view, we claim that science can be seen as the collection, transformation and use of evidence to model the natural world.

Prior literature studying breakthroughs generally treats them as a homogeneous group in attempts to identify supportive conditions for their occurrence. In this paper, we argue that there are different types of scientific breakthroughs, which differ in their disciplinary occurrence and are associated with different considerations of use and citation impact patterns. We develop a typology of scientific breakthroughs based on three binary dimensions of scientific discoveries and use this typology to analyze qualitatively the content of 335 scientific articles that report on breakthroughs. For each dimension, we test associations with scientific disciplines, reported use considerations, and scientific impact. We find that most scientific breakthroughs are driven by a question and in line with literature, and that paradigm shifting discoveries are rare. Regarding the scientific impact of breakthrough as measured by citations, we find that an article that answers an unanswered question receives more citations compared to articles that were not motivated by an unanswered question. We conclude that earlier research in which breakthroughs were operationalized as highly cited scientific articles may thus be biased against the latter. © 2020 Mignon Wuestman, Jarno Hoekman, and Koen Frenken.

The present research systematically tested whether such trait–outcome associations generalize across gender, age, ethnicity, and analytic approaches that control for demographic and personality covariates. Analyses of nationally representative samples from the Life Outcomes of Personality Replication project (N = 6,126) indicated that (a) most trait–outcome associations do generalize across gender, age, and ethnicity; (b) controlling for overlap between personality traits substantially reduces the strength of many associations; and (c) several dozen trait–outcome associations proved highly generalizable across all analyses.

We found that the average effect size in intelligence research was a Pearson’s correlation of 0.26, and the median sample size was 60. Furthermore, across primary studies, we found a median power of 11.9% to detect a small effect, 54.5% to detect a medium effect, and 93.9% to detect a large effect. We documented differences in average effect size and median estimated power between different types of intelligence studies (correlational studies, studies of group differences, experiments, toxicology, and behavior genetics). On average, across all meta-analyses (but not in every meta-analysis), we found evidence for small-study effects, potentially indicating publication bias and overestimated effects. We found no differences in small-study effects between different study types. We also found no convincing evidence for the decline effect, US effect, or citation bias across meta-analyses. We concluded that intelligence research does show signs of low power and publication bias, but that these problems seem less severe than in many other scientific fields. © 2020 by the authors.

Although large-scale bibliometric data have been used to measure international migration of scholars, our understanding of internal migration among researchers is very limited. This is partly due to a lack of data aggregated at a suitable sub-national level. In this study, we analyze internal migration in Mexico based on over 1.1 million authorship records from the Scopus database. We trace the movements of scholars between Mexican states, and provide key demographic measures of internal migration for the 1996–2018 period. From a methodological perspective, we develop a new framework for enhancing data quality, inferring states from affiliations, and detecting moves from modal states for the purposes of studying internal migration among researchers. Substantively, we combine demographic and network science techniques to improve our understanding of internal migration patterns within country boundaries. The migration patterns between states in Mexico appear to be heterogeneous in size and direction across regions. However, while many scholars remain in their regions, there seems to be a preference for Mexico City and the surrounding states as migration destinations. We observed that over the past two decades, there has been a general decreasing trend in the crude migration intensity. However, the migration network has become more dense and more diverse, and has included greater exchanges between states along the Gulf and the Pacific Coast. Our analysis, which is mostly empirical in nature, lays the foundations for testing and developing theories that can rely on the analytical framework developed by migration scholars, and the richness of appropriately processed bibliometric data. © 2020, The Author(s).",Brain circulation; Computational demography; High-skilled migration; Internal migration; Network science; Science of science,EPJ Data Science,Article,2020,17,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1140/epjds/s13688-020-00252-9

In the progress of science, the previously discovered knowledge principally inspires new scientific ideas, and citation is a reasonably good reection of this cumulative nature of scientific research. The researchers that choose potentially inuential references will have a lead over the emerging publications. Although the peer-review process is the mainly reliable way of predicting a paper's future impact, the ability to foresee the lasting impact based on citation records is increasingly essential in the scientific impact analysis in the era of big data. This paper develops an attention mechanism for the long-term scientific impact prediction and validates the method based on a real large-scale citation data set.

Replicability allows others to perform replications to explore potential errors and statistical issues that might call the original results into question. Little attention, however, has been paid to the state of replicability in the field of empirical legal research (ELR). Quality is especially important in this field because empirical legal researchers produce work that is regularly relied upon by courts and other legal bodies. In this review, we summarize the current state of ELR relative to the broader movement toward replicability in the social sciences. As part of that aim, we summarize recent collective replication efforts in ELR and transparency and replicability guidelines adopted by journals that publish ELR. Based on this review, ELR seems to be lagging other fields in implementing reforms. We conclude with suggestions for reforms that might encourage improved replicability. © 2021 Annual Reviews Inc..

Historically, most of the studies from which such data are derived have been econometric or “scientometric” in nature, focusing on the development of quantitative data, models, and metrics of the scientific process as well as outputs and outcomes. Broader definitions of research impact, however, necessitate the use of qualitative case-study methods. For many years, U.S. federal science agencies such as the National Institutes of Health have demonstrated the impact of the research they support through tracing studies that document critical events in the development of successful technologies. A significant disadvantage and barrier of such studies is the labor-intensive nature of a case study approach. Currently, however, the same data infrastructures that have been developed to support scientometrics may also facilitate historical tracing studies.

However, they often suffer from incompleteness (e.g., missing affiliations, references, research topics), leading to a reduced scope and quality of the resulting analyses. This issue is usually tackled by computing knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and applying link prediction techniques. However, only a few KGE models are capable of taking weights of facts in the knowledge graph into account. Such weights can have different meanings, e.g. describe the degree of association or the degree of truth of a certain triple. In this paper, we propose the Weighted Triple Loss, a new loss function for KGE models that takes full advantage of the additional numerical weights on facts and it is even tolerant to incorrect weights. We also extend the Rule Loss, a loss function that is able to exploit a set of logical rules, in order to work with weighted triples. The evaluation of our solutions on several knowledge graphs indicates significant performance improvements with respect to the state of the art. Our main use case is the large-scale AIDA knowledge graph, which describes 21 million research articles. Our approach enables to complete information about affiliation types, countries, and research topics, greatly improving the scope of the resulting scientometrics analyses and providing better support to systems for monitoring and predicting research dynamics. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The intention is an analysis of articles in the field of eliminating the biomedical consequences of the Chernobyl accident in the world and in Russia, indexed in the Scopus database in 1986–2018. A search query gave an array of 3929 articles in Scopus. The largest number of articles was published by authors from the USA (13.2%), Ukraine (12.6%) and Russia (12.2%). A significant number of articles were published by international authors. The average annual number of articles was (119±6) in the whole array and (15±2) in the Russian array. In the whole array, 11.5% of the articles dealt with the biomedical problems of the liquidators of the consequences of the Chernobyl accident; 12.5% – the population living in the radioactively-contaminated territories; 18.7% – neoplasms; 8.6% – medical radiation physics; 21.2% – radioecology; 12.0% – biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology. In the Russian array, these respective percentages were 19.8, 17.3, 18.1, 21.7, 18.8% and 10.2%. On average, there were 10.5 citations per article, 70% of the articles were at least once cited, self-citations made up to 17.6%, and the Hirsch index was 81. A quite high demand for articles in the field of eliminating the biomedical consequences of the Chernobyl accident has been revealed among the world scientific community. Russian scientists should form a habit of quoting articles from their colleagues more often. Some domestic magazines still have a low publishing culture.

To assess whether there are gender differences in citation impact that might help to explain either of these trends, this study investigates psychology articles since 1996. Seven out of eight Scopus psychology categories had a majority of female first-authored journal articles by 2018. From regression analyses of first and last author gender and team size, female first authors associate with a slightly higher average citation impact, but extra authors have a 10 times stronger association with higher average citation impact. Last author gender has little association with citation impact. Female first authors are more likely to be in larger teams and if team size is attributed to the first author's work, then their apparent influence of female first authors on citation impact doubles. While gender differences in average citation impact are too small to account for gender-related trends in academic psychology, they warn that male-dominated citation-based ranking lists of psychologists do not reflect the state of psychology research today. © 2019 International Union of Psychological Science",Academic publishing; Bibliometrics; Citation impact; Gender; Science of science,International Journal of Psychology,Article,2020,9,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1002/ijop.12633

Perceptions of Replicability in Psychological Science,"Judgments regarding replicability are vital to scientific progress. The metaphor of “standing on the shoulders of giants” encapsulates the notion that progress is made when new discoveries build on previous findings. Yet attempts to build on findings that are not replicable could mean a great deal of time, effort, and money wasted. In light of the recent “crisis of confidence” in psychological science, the ability to accurately judge the replicability of findings may be more important than ever. In this Registered Report, we examine the factors that influence psychological scientists’ confidence in the replicability of findings. We recruited corresponding authors of articles published in psychology journals between 2014 and 2018 to complete a brief survey in which they were asked to consider 76 specific study attributes that might bear on the replicability of a finding (e.g., preregistration, sample size, statistical methods). Participants were asked to rate the extent to which information regarding each attribute increased or decreased their confidence in the finding being replicated. We examined the extent to which each research attribute influenced average confidence in replicability. We found evidence for six reasonably distinct underlying factors that influenced these judgments and individual differences in the degree to which people’s judgments were influenced by these factors. The conclusions reveal how certain research practices affect other researchers’ perceptions of robustness. We hope our findings will help encourage the use of practices that promote replicability and, by extension, the cumulative progress of psychological science. © The Author(s) 2021.",attitudes; metascience; open data; open materials; preregistered; replicability; reproducibility,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,Article,2021,6,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1177/25152459211018199

How the Battle for Methodological Legitimacy Affects Public Psychology,"Part of the “boundary work” (Gieryn, 1983) throughout the history of psychology has been to divide the discipline into camps of “basic” and “applied” researchers who take different methodological approaches to construct knowledge. Each “side” has come up with different processes for conceptualizing, constructing, and evaluating the legitimacy of knowledge claims, processes that have implications for applying research insights to practical issues in society. In this article, I review and synthesize research on the history of knowledge construction in both basic and applied psychology, and the implications of their respective methodological practices for their perceived legitimacy. I then discuss how the lessons learned from the past can be leveraged to address the current crisis of confidence in the “credibility revolution” era (Vazire, 2018), as well as the field’s perceived legitimacy to external stakeholders.

Schmid J.,57200641867,NA,"""It is so because I do it that way"". Fichte's method of construction; [»Es ist so, weil ich es so mache.« Fichtes Methode der Konstruktion]","In this paper I develop an account of Fichte’s conception of philosophical construction. Following the latter’s definition of philosophy as the ‘science of science’, philosophy is to be understood as a normative theory of what should qualify as science. In order to ground scientific knowledge-production as such, philosophy itself has to acquire a scientific method, through the application of which the constitution of scientific knowledge is secured. In systematic continuity to Kant’s account of geometrical construction, Fichte develops a philosophical method that exploits the special epistemic conditions of performativity. Construction is then defined as an experimental, self-reflexive performance that exemplifies consciousness. Throughout its acts of exemplification this reflexive kind of self-observation yields a particular type of experience, which ultimately satisfies the Science of Knowledge’s demand for certainty, that is intellectual intuition. © 2020 Brill Rodopi.

It has played an important role in evaluating researchers, scientific papers, scientific teams, and institutions within science of science. Scholarly impact assessment is also used to address fundamental issues, such as reward evaluation, funding allocation, promotion and recruitment decision. Scholars generally agree that it is more reasonable to use weighted citations to assess the scholarly impact. Although a great number of researchers use weighted citations to access the scholarly impact, there is a lack of a systematic summary of citation weighting methods. To fill the gap, this paper summarizes the existing classical indicators and weighting methods used in measuring scholarly impact from the perspectives of articles, authors and journals. We also summarize the focus of the indicators involved in this paper and the weighting factors that involved in the weighting methods. Finally, we discuss the open issues to try to discover the hidden trends of citation weighting.

Compared with previous research regarding the aspects of semiotics being meta-science, the three dimensions of semiosis, semiotic as organon of the sciences, etc., this article does push forward the development of linguistics and semiotics since the late 1930s. However, its discussions on semiotics being meta-science, the nature and classification of signs, the three dimensions of semiosis, organism in the sign relations, universals and universality of signs, and thing-language are either not logically rigid or inadequate in content and scope. For a piece of work discussing the theoretical foundations of signs, it does not consider sign transformation, a universal and ubiquitous sign activity, which is not consistent with the keyword ""foundations"" in its title. A critical analysis of these problems involving the aspects mentioned above may not only enrich the visions of triadic sign relations, semiotics, and translation semiotics, but also inspire future semiotic studies and even other new research related to signs. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",meta-science; pragmatics; semantics; semiosis; syntactics; universality,Chinese Semiotic Studies,Article,2019,3,NA,English,10.1515/css-2019-0001

To improve the quality of publications while maintaining their growth rate, employees of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia have approved a methodology for assessing the integrated score of publication performance of organizations. Intention. Analysis of the integrated score of publication performance of the leading educational and scientific organizations of the Russian Emergencies Ministry for 10 years (2010–2019). Methodology. The object of the study was the annual indicators of the integrated score of publication performance of the Russian EMERCOM as calculated by the staff of the Scientific Electronic Library [https://www.elibrary.ru/]. Results and Discussion. A low average annual integrated score of publication performance was revealed in the EMERCOM of Russia. For an educational organization in the Russian EMERCOM, it amounted to (55.67 ±5.8) points, for a research organization – (29.0 ± 1.5) points (p < 0.01). The average annual integrated score of publication performance for the same period at Omsk State Technical University turned out to be 6 times higher (306.4 ± 19.0) than the average for educational institutions of the Russian EMERCOM (p < 0.001). It turned out that the EMERCOM of Russia had few highly rated publications on computer and information sciences, physical and chemical branches of knowledge, and quite a lot of publications on social sciences. Most likely, the latter are not a priority in the state assignment for research and development of the EMERCOM of Russia. Shown are the ways to increase the integrated score of publication performance of the EMERCOM of Russia organizations. Conclusion. The slogan of researchers “print or die” in modern conditions is becoming less and less relevant. Russian and world science were flooded with insignificant and sometimes false publications. The fractional calculation of the integrated score of publication performance will make the authors think before including anyone in gift co-authorship or creating “fake” affiliations.

One incentive in particular, rewarding priority of publication, is hypothesized to harm scientific reliability by promoting rushed, low-quality research. Here, we develop a laboratory experiment to test whether competition affects information sampling and guessing accuracy in a game that mirrors aspects of scientific investigation. In our experiment, individuals gather data in order to guess true states of the world and face a tradeoff between guessing quickly and increasing accuracy by acquiring more information. To test whether competition affects accuracy, we compare a treatment in which individuals are rewarded for each correct guess to a treatment where individuals face the possibility of being 'scooped' by a competitor. In a second set of conditions, we make information acquisition contingent on solving arithmetic problems to test whether competition increases individual effort (i.e. arithmetic-problem solving speed). We find that competition causes individuals to make guesses using less information, thereby reducing their accuracy (H1a and H1b confirmed). We find no evidence that competition increases individual effort (H2, inconclusive evidence). Our experiment provides proof of concept that rewarding priority of publication can incentivize individuals to acquire less information, producing lower-quality research as a consequence. © 2019 The Authors.",Competition; Incentive structures; Information sampling; Metascience; Priority rule,Royal Society Open Science,Article,2019,6,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1098/rsos.180934

This imbalance is often attributed to a meritocratic system that sorts individuals into more-prestigious positions according to their reputation, past achievements, and potential for future scholarly impact. Here, we investigate the determinants of scholarly productivity and measure their dependence on past training and current work environments. To distinguish the effects of these environments, we apply a matched-pairs experimental design to career and productivity trajectories of 2,453 early-career faculty at all 205 PhD-granting computer science departments in the United States and Canada, who together account for over 200,000 publications and 7.4 million citations. Our results show that the prestige of faculty’s current work environment, not their training environment, drives their future scientific productivity, while current and past locations drive prominence. Furthermore, the characteristics of a work environment are more predictive of faculty productivity and impact than mechanisms representing preferential selection or retention of more-productive scholars by more-prestigious departments. These results identify an environmental mechanism for cumulative advantage, in which an individual’s past successes are “locked in” via placement into a more prestigious environment, which directly facilitates future success. The scientific productivity of early-career faculty is thus driven by where they work, rather than where they trained for their doctorate, indicating a limited role for doctoral prestige in predicting scientific contributions. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

The use of descriptive statistics from published research offers an alternative to assess the reproducibility and robustness of selected prior research. The Stakeholders: In addition to validating research before applying implications for practice in the field, practitioners could benefit from working with scholars and scholar-practitioners by assessing analytic robustness and reevaluating data through a new framework to address burgeoning organizational problems, potentially saving resources.

Although these goals are in principle compatible, the goal of conveying complex and variable data may compete with reporting results in a digestible form that fits (increasingly) limited publication formats. As a result, authors' choices may favor clarity over complexity. For example, generic language (e.g., ""Introverts and extraverts require different learning environments"") may mislead by implying general, timeless conclusions while glossing over exceptions and variability. Using generic language is especially problematic if authors overgeneralize from small or unrepresentative samples (e.g., exclusively Western, middle-class). We present 4 studies examining the use and implications of generic language in psychology research articles. Study 1, a text analysis of 1,149 psychology articles published in 11 journals in 2015 and 2016, examined the use of generics in titles, research highlights, and abstracts. We found that generics were ubiquitously used to convey results (89% of articles included at least 1 generic), despite that most articles made no mention of sample demographics. Generics appeared more frequently in shorter units of the paper (i.e., highlights more than abstracts), and generics were not associated with sample size. Studies 2 to 4 (n = 1,578) found that readers judged results expressed with generic language to be more important and generalizable than findings expressed with nongeneric language. We highlight potential unintended consequences of language choice in scientific communication, as well as what these choices reveal about how scientists think about their data. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

In these texts, the Soviet historiographic process of the 1920s and 1930s was interpreted. The relevance of the study is associated both with the poor study of historiographic texts created during that period in emigration, and with the narrative turn of modern historical science, as well as with the experience of understanding the structure and nature of the Soviet narrative, which is beginning to be comprehended and problematized as an independent problem. The study of narratives makes it possible to move away from general assessments of the Soviet stage of historical studies to a more specific description of it through studying the stylistics of the text, isolating the standards and the uniqueness of their construction, with close attention to the problems of their unification. This process can be clarified and refined through the prism of the “emigre mirror”. The source base was the historiographic texts of P.N. Milyukov, A.A. Kizevetter, A.V. Florovsky, and E.F. Maksimovich in the form of published works and manuscript heritage from the archives of the Russian Academy of Sciences (ARAN) and the Slavic Library in Prague (Slovanská knihovna v Praze). Based on textual analysis and developments in the field of intellectual history, the author highlights the unifying features of the émigré narrative. These include: 1) scholars’ understanding of their special mission in emigration which consists of preserving the historiographic tradition and presenting Russian historical science to the world community as part of world science; 2) close attention to the classics, focus on tradition; 3) an assessment of the historiographic process within the framework of the reference time, the Golden age of pre-revolutionary historical science (late 19th – early 20th centuries); the criterion for assessing the current historiographic process was the compliance with the experience of Moscow and St. Petersburg scientific schools; 4) a statement about the lack of freedom of research, the monopoly of Marxist methodology and the hypertrophied class approach in relation to the historicist views of historians; 5) changes in the form and structure of the classic narrative – the proportion of reviews, literature reviews, obituaries in the structure of emigrant narrative was increasing; the deconstruction of the old narrative followed the path of its archaization; 6) the unifying factor that tightened the texts, gave them tension and a special emotional charge, was the figure of M.N. Pokrovsky. However, the verification of the current historiographic process by one’s own past is not without contradictions. On the one hand, this ensures the continuity of historiographic knowledge and confirms the thesis of the intrinsic value of the so-called «outdated innovations». In addition, in this regard, we can talk about the fundamental eclecticism of science as a cultural tradition. On the other hand, the reciprocating nature is fraught with a closure on the old. The absolutization of tradition leads to the blocking of intellectual transfers. In science of science, this process is called the rut effect. As an example of searching for «one’s own track», the article presents an attempt by A.V. Florovsky to understand and to clarify the phenomenon of Soviet historiography by coarsening the classical historiographic approach and using the inventory-registration method.

In this paper, we present a study on a specific research network: The (relational) database community publication graph, that we call Codd’s World; a transitive closure over citations from the foundational work of E.F. Codd. We specifically analyze the topics of the published papers, the relevance of authors and papers, and how this relates to raw publication counts.

In this paper, we address this problem of quantitative knowledge evolution by analyzing the APS data sets from 1981 to 2010. We build the bibliographic coupling and co-citation networks, use the Louvain method to detect topical clusters (TCs) in each year, measure the similarity of TCs in consecutive years, and visualize the results as alluvial diagrams. Having the predictive features describing a given TC and its known evolution in the next year, we can train a machine learning model to predict future changes of TCs, i.e., their continuing, dissolving, merging, and splitting. We found the number of papers from certain journals, the degree, closeness, and betweenness to be the most predictive features. Additionally, betweenness increased significantly for merging events and decreased significantly for splitting events. Our results represent the first step from a descriptive understanding of the science of science (SciSci), towards one that is ultimately prescriptive. © 2019 by the authors.",Knowledge evolution; Machine learning; SciSci,Entropy,Article,2019,6,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.3390/e21121152

We study how a single paper affects the IF using data from 11639 journals in the 2017 Journal Citation Reports. We define as volatility the IF gain (or loss) caused by a single paper, and this is inversely proportional to journal size. We find high volatilities for hundreds of journals annually due to their top-cited paper—whether it is a highly-cited paper in a small journal, or a moderately (or even low) cited paper in a small and low-cited journal. For example, 1218 journals had their most cited paper boost their IF by more than 20%, while for 231 journals the boost exceeded 50%. We find that small journals are rewarded much more than large journals for publishing a highly-cited paper, and are also penalized more for publishing a low-cited paper, especially if they have a high IF. This produces a strong incentive for prestigious, high-IF journals to stay small, to remain competitive in IF rankings. We discuss the implications for breakthrough papers to appear in prestigious journals. We also question the practice of ranking journals by IF given this uneven reward mechanism. © 2019 17th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, ISSI 2019 - Proceedings.

Psychology has been a leader in identifying possibly suboptimal practices and proposing reforms that might enhance the efficiency of the scientific process and the publication of robust evidence and interpretations. To help shape future efforts, this paper offers a model of the psychological and socio-structural forces and processes that may influence scientists' practices. The model identifies practices targeted by interventions and reforms, and which practices remain unaddressed. The model also suggests directions for empirical research to assess how best to enhance the effectiveness of psychological inquiry. Copyright: © 2019 The Author(s).

Moskopp W.,57194517945,"University of Koblenz-Landau, Campus Koblenz, Germany","""verbindlichkeit"": Some drafts of a groundwork in moral philosophy","All of metaethical positions today can be replaced by a universal architecture of moral philosophy, all but one: moral realism. Here, I use the term ""metaethics"" to refer to any theory of ethics concerning the groundwork of ethics, on the one hand, and the inquiry of the use of philosophical words, concepts or methods on the other. In this article, I will present my hypothesis that in moral philosophy, we do not need any specialized metaethics at all. Metaethics as a discipline of philosophy is only required by the work of moral realists, who try to show us a realm of values and norms that exist (per se) naturally, non-naturally or supernaturally. How can they know? The effort of metaethical realists cannot be proven either in ontology or in the philosophy of language or in cognitive science or in any meta-science that works en plus to ethics, because even in every additional discipline, we have to accept the presupposition of a validity of judgments. So, let us try it the other way around; we have to find a way to found ethics by following its structures, and that means, based on David Velleman's concepts: a) We have to search for a ubiquitous point of ethical theory in its foundation-here, no kind of value or norm can be found that is not based on a universal formal structure of normativity. b) We have to start an empirical inquiry to collect norms and values in actual use. MFT, moral psychology and moral sociology are in charge here. The combination of such an abstract groundwork with mere empirical study has to be legitimized again. Hence, I am going to try to sum up the main ideas of such a project to show the relevance of a new architecture of moral philosophy today. There is a line of reasoning that addresses the possibility of a transcendental critique in practical philosophy; therefore, it has to look into the different notions of ""intuition"" in moral methods like it was used by Sidgwick (Rashdall, Green, Ross, Brentano, McTaggart) and Moore on the one hand and Brentano and Bergson on the other. In my view, there is a way to combine these perspectives using the two-level-model of Hare, Singer, Greene, where ""intuition"" is used to categorize habits and customs of the common sense morality in general while a critical reflection uses act-utilitarian calculus to provide a universal decision-in the sense of ""concrete reason""-for any possible actor in a singular situation (Hegel, Peirce, Bloch etc.). The change between these levels may be explained by means of a pragmatistic kind of continuum of research with an ideal summum bonum in the long run and a concept of common sense morality as can be found in every group or society. © 2019 Werner Moskopp, published by Sciendo 2019.",groundwork; personalism; pragmatism; transcendental critique; ubiquity; universality,Ethics and Bioethics (in Central Europe),Article,2019,1,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.2478/ebce-2019-0002

The Life Outcomes of Personality Replication Project,"The Big Five personality traits have been linked to dozens of life outcomes. However, metascientific research has raised questions about the replicability of behavioral science. The Life Outcomes of Personality Replication (LOOPR) Project was therefore conducted to estimate the replicability of the personality-outcome literature. Specifically, I conducted preregistered, high-powered (median N = 1,504) replications of 78 previously published trait–outcome associations. Overall, 87% of the replication attempts were statistically significant in the expected direction. The replication effects were typically 77% as strong as the corresponding original effects, which represents a significant decline in effect size. The replicability of individual effects was predicted by the effect size and design of the original study, as well as the sample size and statistical power of the replication. These results indicate that the personality-outcome literature provides a reasonably accurate map of trait–outcome associations but also that it stands to benefit from efforts to improve replicability. © The Author(s) 2019.",Big Five; life outcomes; metascience; open data; open materials; personality traits; preregistered; replication,Psychological Science,Article,2019,279,NA,English,10.1177/0956797619831612

This article aims to perform quantitative analysis on physical systems, that is, to answer questions about values of quantitative state variables of a physical system with known structure. For this objective, we incorporate procedural knowledge on two distinct levels. At the domain-specific level, we propose a representation model for scientific knowledge, i.e. variables, theories, and laws of nature. At the domain-independent level, we provide an algorithm which, given a system S with known structure and a relevant scientific theory T, extracts a constraint network, whose variables are state variables of S defined by T, and whose constraints raise from relevant laws in T. The constraint network is then solved, to build a system of equations whose unknowns are the output variables of S. The proposed representation model and reasoning algorithm are evaluated by applying them to classic analysis examples. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

Scientifically and accurately identifying core scientific research teams is an important prerequisite for cultivating and building such teams. The absolute threshold method (e.g., c-level clique at, n- clique, kcore) is the prevailing means of identifying core teams and their core members. Multiple factors such as ""the preference-dependent effect"", ""the apostle effect"" and ""the star effect"", and the cooperative relationship between the researchers could be considered. This study, based on the co-authorship network, found that not choosing the absolute threshold properly could easily lead to poor identification of core members of some teams. Even worse, when the absolute threshold is too large, this ""uniform"" evaluation criterion of tie strength results in the elimination of some core teams in some disciplines. This paper uses the relative tie strength to identify core scientific research teams from a new perspective, which can effectively avoid the situation of some core team members being ignored because of the mandatory requirements of the absolute tie strength among members, and can also solve the challenge of threshold selections for identifying different teams. © 2019 Kassel University Press GmbH.",Relative strength of cooperative relationship; Science of science; Scientific cooperation; Scientific research team; Team core members; Team leaders,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning,Article,2019,1,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.3991/ijet.v14i23.10394

Evidence from Medical Ethics co-authorship networks in France: A micro study,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify embedded communities among Medical Ethics scholars in France based on their position and strength of association in the social networks they form. Design/methodology/approach: The author constructed a co-authorship network by linking two authors if they co-authored a paper. Once the co-authorship network was constructed, the author investigated the entire network quantitatively using standard research methods known as social network analysis. The author’s mechanism of community detection was via identification, i.e. communities were user-defined based on topological analysis. Findings: The study identified that communities formed by trust (bonding or repeat connections) or by prestige (connection of well-connected scholars with those that are already well-connected) overlap each other, suggesting that trust and prestige may go hand in hand in sustaining communities. Structural holes within trust networks indicated that some actors played more of a broker role than did other actors. Research limitations/implications: The study uses Web of Science field based category to extract data. Although thorough cleaning of data has been performed, author disambiguation over a three decade period remains a limitation. Originality/value: Although there have been numerous studies on mapping co-authorship networks, there has been limited work investigating the underlying communities formed by author associations.

The chapter shows that the issue of understanding past research practice constitutes a suitable research problem for history-and-philosophy-of-science (iHPS). It explains scientists’ research practices, material, social and epistemic factors need to be considered together, which is why the input from both History of Science and Philosophy of Science is necessary. The chapter also argues that mainstream History of Science and mainstream Philosophy of Science tend to leave interesting questions unanswered - questions that iHPS scholarship can resolve.

The replication crisis in science has led to widespread efforts to improve the reliability of research findings, but comparatively little attention has been devoted to the validity of inferences based on those findings. Using an example from cognitive psychology, we demonstrate a blinded-inference paradigm for assessing the quality of theoretical inferences from data.

Quantifying trends in researchers’ movements is key to understanding the drivers of the mobility of talent, as well as the implications of these patterns for the global system of science, and for the competitive advantages of individual countries. Existing studies have investigated bilateral flows of researchers. However, in order to understand migration systems, determining the extent to which researchers have worked in more than two countries is essential. This study focuses on the subgroup of highly mobile researchers whom we refer to as “peripatetic researchers” or “super-movers.” More specifically, our aim is to track the international movements of researchers who have published in more than two countries through changes in the main affiliation addresses of over 62 million publications indexed in the Web of Science database over the 1956–2016 period. Using this approach, we have established a longitudinal dataset on the international movements of highly mobile researchers across all subject categories, and in all disciplines of scholarship. This article contributes to the literature by offering for the first time a snapshot of the key features of highly mobile researchers, including their patterns of migration and return migration by academic age, the relative frequency of their disciplines, and the relative frequency of their countries of origin and destination. Among other findings, the results point to the emergence of a global system that includes the USA and China as two large hubs, and England and Germany as two smaller hubs for highly mobile researchers. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Bibliometric data; Big data; High-skilled migration; Science of science; Web of Science,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Conference paper,2019,17,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1007/978-3-030-34971-4_4

The sheer amount of information available is overwhelming for individual humans to keep up and digest. In the meantime, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have made great strides and the cost of computing has plummeted to the extent that it has become practical to employ intelligent agents to comprehensively collect and analyze scholarly communications. MAS is one such effort and this paper describes its recent progresses since the last disclosure. As there are plenty of independent studies affirming the effectiveness of MAS, this paper focuses on the use of three key AI technologies that underlies its prowess in capturing scholarly communications with adequate quality and broad coverage: (1) natural language understanding in extracting factoids from individual articles at the web scale, (2) knowledge assisted inference and reasoning in assembling the factoids into a knowledge graph, and (3) a reinforcement learning approach to assessing scholarly importance for entities participating in scholarly communications, called the saliency, that serves both as an analytic and a predictive metric in MAS. These elements enhance the capabilities of MAS in supporting the studies of science of science based on the GOTO principle, i.e., good and open data with transparent and objective methodologies. The current direction of development and how to access the regularly updated data and tools from MAS, including the knowledge graph, a REST API and a website, are also described.

The data show that people care greatly about research dealing with humans: links tagged as psychology, social sciences, and health are upvoted more than other categories on Reddit. Within the category of psychology, articles were coded based on the topic of research. Articles dealing generally with social psychological topics are among the highest in number and upvotes on the subreddit r/Science. Many posts were upvoted tens of thousands of times. However, upvotes on Reddit are unrelated to scientific publishing metrics (e.g., impact factor, journal rankings, and citations), suggesting a disconnect between what psychologists and Redditors may see as relevant. These findings also highlight some points for reflection. For example, psychologists may benefit from thinking about the purpose, goals, and beneficiaries of the research they pursue. Additionally, the level of attention that some psychological research receives has implications for transparent research practices. Researchers have a responsibility to ensure that findings are reported accurately and transparently because, whether scientists like it or not, people care about psychological research, they share it, and use it in their lives. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

The 2010 reform of the Italian university system introduced the National Scientific Habilitation (ASN) as a requirement for applying to permanent professor positions. Since the CVs of the 59,149 candidates and the results of their assessments have been made publicly available, the ASN constitutes an opportunity to perform analyses about a nation-wide evaluation process. Objective. The main goals of this paper are: (i) predicting the ASN results using the information contained in the candidates’ CVs; (ii) identifying a small set of quantitative indicators that can be used to perform accurate predictions. Approach. Semantic technologies are used to extract, systematize and enrich the information contained in the applicants’ CVs, and machine learning methods are used to predict the ASN results and to identify a subset of relevant predictors. Results. For predicting the success in the role of associate professor, our best models using all and the top 15 predictors make accurate predictions (F-measure values higher than 0.6) in 88% and 88.6% of the cases, respectively. Similar results have been achieved for the role of full professor. Evaluation. The proposed approach outperforms the other models developed to predict the results of researchers’ evaluation procedures. Conclusions. Such results allow the development of an automated system for supporting both candidates and committees in the future ASN sessions and other scholars’ evaluation procedures.

The field of inquiry of meta-science emerged originally in reaction to problems with reproducibility and replicability of seemingly settled science. These same problems could affect research evidence conducted by human resource development (HRD) researchers and, as a result, could limit the applicability of HRD research outcomes to HRD practice. The Solution: Discussed in this article are examples of meta-scientific issues and solutions that ultimately affect the transition of knowledge derived through research to practice in the field of HRD. Problems with the reproducibility and replication of research conducted in the field are detailed as are meta-scientific issues involved in judging the quality of scientific work, methodology-agnostic applications of meta-scientific inquiry, requirements for sharing data and code, and the need to let theory guide research. The Stakeholders: Researchers would benefit from the considerations of meta-scientific concerns in the design, conduct, and reporting of research to improve the replicability and reproducibility of research outcomes. Knowledge of meta-scientific principles and cautions by adopters of research outcomes would inject healthy skepticism into decisions about whether research outcomes are worthy for application in practice or to guide future research. © The Author(s) 2019.",evaluation; evidence-based practice; knowledge management; measurement/metrics,Advances in Developing Human Resources,Article,2019,3,NA,English,10.1177/1523422319870173

Such a model is formalized according to the theory of unity of knowledge in the light of the Primal Ontology of Divine Oneness called Tawhid in the Qur'an. Tawhid is argued to be the only foundational Law of Islam respecting “everything.” The implications of such an epistemic treatment in respect of waqf as an example of the whole class of charities in Islam is shown to be unlike the dissociative and human opinionated nature of what has now come to be known as “shari'ah-compliance.” The Islamic shortfall of “shari'ah-compliance” and its segmentation as opposed to organically unified synergy between the socioeconomic and moral/ethical variables of the objective criterion called the Well-being Function have deprived the entire study of the present days' Islamic economics, finance, and banking from its true epistemological core of Tawhid as Law. To restore this true foundation in Islamic thought, a theory of metascience of Tawhid is presented. Waqf in Malaysia is studied as an example from the perspective of Tawhidi unity of knowledge, contrary to its existing dissociative presence in the ethically exogenous socioeconomic treatment under “shari'ah-compliance.”. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",epistemology; ethical endogeneity; ontology; shari'ah; Tawhid; unity of knowledge; waqf in development ethics,Thunderbird International Business Review,Article,2019,6,NA,English,10.1002/tie.22039

Yet the probability that the relationship is real is a function not only of recurring results, but also of the quality and consistency of the empirical procedures that produced those results and that any meta-analysis necessarily inherits. Standardized protocols in data collection, analysis, and interpretation are foundations of empiricism and a healthy sign of a discipline’s maturity. I propose that meta-analysis as typically applied in psychology will benefit from complementing aggregation of observed effect sizes with systematic examination of the standardization of the methodology that deterministically produced them. I describe potential units of analysis and offer two examples illustrating the benefits of such efforts.

How to allocate credit reasonably to coauthors of a paper is a long-standing problem in the science of sciences. The collective credit allocation method (CCA method) proposed by Shen, H. W. and Barabási, A. L. provides a novel view to solve this problem, which measures the coauthors’ contribution to a paper based on the citation process by the scientific community. Nevertheless, the existing collective allocation method assigns equal weights to citing papers, which is sensitive to the malicious manipulation. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear collective credit allocation method (NCCA method) that assigns different strength to citing papers according to papers’ scientific impact when measuring papers’ similarity. Compared to the CCA method, we find that the NCCA method assigns more credits to Nobel laureates in the Nobel-winning papers. Moreover, the NCCA method is robust against random perturbations and the malicious manipulation in both Nobel-prize papers and ordinary papers.

Survey respondents were particularly concerned about sharing sensitive data, the risk of malicious practices, publishing in low-impact open access outlets, and indicated that open science seemed mainly targeted at quantitative research.

This observation is attributed to the growth of cross-field communication throughout the entire period as well as the growing importance of high-impact papers to bridge networks in the same year. Three empirical findings support this conclusion. First, distances decreased between almost all disciplines throughout the time period. Second, inequality in the number of citations received by papers increased, and, as a consequence, the shortest paths in the network depend more on high-impact papers later in the period. Third, the dispersion of connections between fields increased continually. Moreover, these changes did not entail a lower level of clustering of citations. Both within- and cross-field citations show a similar rate of slowly growing clustering values in all years. The latter findings suggest that domain-spanning scholarly communication is partly enabled by new fields that connect disciplines. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the field, a diverse but not divided network science community has emerged in the past 20 years. This paper honors the contributions of network science by exploring the evolution of this community as seen through the growing co-authorship network of network scientists (here the notion refers to a scholar with at least one paper citing at least one of the three aforementioned milestone papers). After investigating various characteristics of 29,528 network science papers, we construct the co-authorship network of 52,406 network scientists and we analyze its topology and dynamics. We shed light on the collaboration patterns of the last 20 years of network science by investigating numerous structural properties of the co-authorship network and by using enhanced data visualization techniques.

Unfortunately, poor statistical practices can generate erroneous or at least misleading results and distorts the evidence in the scientific literature. These problems are exacerbated when statistics are used as thoughtless ritual that is performed after the data are collected. The situation is worsened when statistics are then treated as strict judgements about the data (i.e., significant versus non-significant) without a thought given to how these statistics were calculated or their practical meaning. We propose that researchers should consider statistics at every step of the research process whether that be the designing of experiments, collecting data, analysing the data or disseminating the results. When statistics are considered as an integral part of the research process, from start to finish, several problematic practices can be mitigated. Further, proper practices in disseminating the results of a study can greatly improve the quality of the literature. Within this review, we have included a number of reminders and statistical questions researchers should answer throughout the scientific process. Rather than treat statistics as a strict rule following procedure we hope that readers will use this review to stimulate a discussion around their current practices and attempt to improve them.

We argue that this is possible only in retrospection and would significantly distort the essence of Leibniz's epistemology. Our approach implies, in contrary, the investigation of the Leibniz doctrine of signs on the background of the related philosophical problem, that of expression. The choice of semiotics is justified by the fact that it took a central place in his theoretical constructions, both those of natural sciences and of philosophy. In Leibniz system of knowledge the concept of notes (notae) and sings (signa) served a theoretical foundation of his most important and long-life aspiration to build up practical science of universal characteristics (characteristica universalis). In his eyes this practical science was the science of sciences (Scientia scientiarum), and we can consider it as the matrix for all possible scientific knowledge. © 2020 RAS Institute of Philosophy.

Shapin S.,6603522151,"Harvard University, 1 Oxford St., Cambridge, 02138, MA, United States",How to be antiscientific,"This article is a response to the science wars that broke out in the mid-1990s. It focuses on an analysis of pragmatics and the nature of the use of statements about science by scientists. What triggered the science wars were the relativistic and constructivist claims of sociologists and historians of science about their field, but the author demonstrates that scientists themselves indulge in similar judgments. As an interested observer, he shows through a series of examples that the metascientific claims of scientists about the nature of science and the scientific method are diverse and often contradict each other. Possible conclusions to be drawn from this variability are then analyzed. The first one is that some metascientific statements by scientists are true and others are false. The second one suggests that all metascientific statements made by working scientists should be ignored. The author shows that both these conclusions are unsatisfactory. The main thrust of the article pertains to the variability of metascientific statements and their relationship with science itself. According to the author, metascientific statements, which often oppose each other, do not describe a single essence of science or a universal scientific method, but they highlight instead specific aspects of scientific practices localized in space, time and cultural context. This makes the relationship between metascience and science contingent, and the question of how to be antiscientific becomes problematic. The author outlines invalid ways to be antiscientific and shows how a relativistic position could be not antiscientific. One can have confidence in the sciences and yet be skeptical about the metascientific statements which offer a single essence of science. The author finds that being for or against a certain essence of science in general means being against nothing very much in particular. What matters is local criticism within a science itself or in the separate parts of it which are associated with specific research or institutional issues. © 2020, Gaidar Institute Press.

We argue that the linear model of "" bench-to-bedside” research, which is also reflected in the present training of MD/PhDs, merits continual re-evaluation to capitalize on the richness of opportunities arising in clinical medicine. In addition to measuring objective career outcomes, as existing research has done, we suggest that detailed characterization of researchers’ efforts using both qualitative and quantitative techniques is necessary to understand if dual-degree training is being utilized. As an example, we propose that the application of machine learning and data science to corpora of biomedical literature and anonymized clinical data might allow us to see if there are objective "" signatures” of research uniquely enabled by MD/PhD training. We close by proposing several hypotheses for shaping physician-scientist training, the relative merits of which could be assessed using the techniques proposed above.

Emerging concerns about the replicability of research findings in clinical psychology highlight the need to critically examine the evidential value of EST research. We therefore conducted a metascientific review of the EST literature, using clinical trials reported in an existing online APA database of ESTs, and a set of novel evidential value metrics (i.e., rates of misreported statistics, statistical power, R-Index, and Bayes Factors). Our analyses indicated that power and replicability estimates were concerningly low across almost all ESTs, and individually, some ESTs scored poorly across multiple metrics, with Strong ESTs failing to continuously outperform their Modest counterparts. Lastly, we found evidence of improvements over time in statistical power within the EST literature, but not for the strength of evidence of EST efficacy.

These recent efforts have not yet circled back to modern clinical psychological research, despite the importance of sample size and power in producing a credible body of evidence. As one step in this process of scientific self-examination, the present study estimated an N-pact Factor (the statistical power of published empirical studies to detect typical effect sizes; Fraley & Vazire, 2014) in 2 leading clinical journals (the Journal of Abnormal Psychology [JAP] and the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology [JCCP]) for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.

We found that, across all years examined, the average median sample size in clinical research was 179 participants (175 for JAP and 182 for JCCP). The power to detect a small to medium effect size of .20 is just below 80% for both journals.

The identification of translational science has practicality such as evaluating the effectiveness of investments made into large programs like the Clinical and Translational Science Awards. Despite several proposed methods that group publications - the primary unit of research output - into some categories, we still lack a quantitative way to place articles onto the full, continuous spectrum from basic research to clinical medicine. Materials and Methods: I learn vector representations of controlled vocabularies assigned to Medline articles to obtain a translational axis that points from basic science to clinical medicine. The projected position of a term on the translational axis, expressed by a continuous quantity, indicates the term's ""appliedness."" The position of an article, determined by the average location over its terms, quantifies the degree of its appliedness, which I term the level score. Results: I validate the present method by comparing with previous techniques, showing excellent agreement yet uncovering significant variations of scores of articles in previously defined categories. The measure allows us to characterize the standing of journals, disciplines, and the entire biomedical literature along the basicapplied spectrum. Analysis on large-scale citation network reveals 2 main findings. First, direct citations mainly occurred between articles with similar scores. Second, shortest paths are more likely ended up with an article closer to the basic end of the spectrum, regardless of where the starting article is on the spectrum.

This is the traditional concept of authorship. But there are good reasons to shift to a contributorship model, under which it is not necessary to contribute to the writing or revision of a manuscript, and all those who make substantial contributions to a project are credited. Many journals and publishers have already taken steps in this direction, and further adoption will have several benefits. This article makes the case for continuing to move down that path. Use of a contributorship model should improve the ability of universities and funders to identify effective individual researchers and improving their ability to identify the right mix of researchers needed to advance modern science. Other benefits should include facilitating the formation of productive collaborations and the creation of important scientific tools and software.

To this purpose, we introduce ResearchFlow, an approach that integrates semantic technologies and machine learning to quantifying the diachronic behaviour of research topics across academia and industry. ResearchFlow exploits the novel Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowledge Graph in order to characterize each topic according to the frequency in time of the related i) publications from academia, ii) publications from industry, iii) patents from academia, and iv) patents from industry. This representation is then used to produce several analytics regarding the academia/industry knowledge flow and to forecast the impact of research topics on industry. We applied ResearchFlow to a dataset of 3.5M papers and 2M patents in Computer Science and highlighted several interesting patterns. We found that 89.8% of the topics first emerge in academic publications, which typically precede industrial publications by about 5.6 years and industrial patents by about 6.6 years. However this does not mean that academia always dictates the research agenda. In fact, our analysis also shows that industrial trends tend to influence academia more than academic trends affect industry.

However, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not changed for decades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart's Law, according to which, ""when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."" Results In this study, we analyzed >120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal's impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of >2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department. Conclusions Academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success. © 2019 The Author(s).",Academic publishing metrics; Big data; Data science; Goodhart's Law; Science of science; Scientometrics,GigaScience,Article,2019,178,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1093/gigascience/giz053

This chapter proposes that an empirical science of science can provide a fresh approach to the field of HPS, capable of fruitfully integrating key components of both History of Science (HS) and Philosophy of Science (PS). It introduces the work currently being done by a community of scholars who have taken Hakob Barseghyan’s The Laws of Scientific Change as a starting point and the theoretical basis for an empirical science of science named scientonomy. A fundamental strength of Barseghyan’s work is that it offers a compelling historical hypothesis for why HS and PS are unintegrated, and crafts a theory of scientific change that explicitly redresses the causes of this unintegration. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Emily Herring, Kevin Matthew Jones, Konstantin S.

In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis on bibliographic dataset to reveal the evolution of information systems in 2 decades (1996–2015). We select 39,767 papers published in 8 top-tier journals and conferences between 1996 and 2015 and explore the anatomy from manifold. We find that IS is experiencing the sustainable growth phase in terms of increased productivity, impact, and collaboration. The field is benefited from collaborative, open-minded, and in-depth efforts evidenced from the growing number of co-authors per paper, the continual declining of self-citation rate, and increased reference age, respectively. By applying topic detection models on paper titles, abstracts, and keywords, we infer the representative topics and research directions, which can also reveal the research landscape within this field.

Objective: The workshop aimed to identify research priorities and opportunities related to RRT. Design: Over two-days, workshop attendees gave presentations and participated in three working groups: (1) Improving Education & Training in RRT, (2) Reducing Statistical Errors and Increasing Analytic Transparency, and (3) Looking Outward: Increasing Truthfulness and Accuracy of Research Communications. Following small-group discussions, the working groups presented their findings, and participants discussed the research opportunities identified. The investigators compiled a list of research priorities, which were circulated to all participants for feedback. Results: Participants identified the following priority research questions: (1) Can RRT-focused statistics and mathematical modeling courses improve statistics practice?; (2) Can specialized training in scientific writing improve transparency?; (3) Does modality (e.g. face to face, online) affect the efficacy RRT-related education?; (4) How can automated programs help identify errors more efficiently?; (5) What is the prevalence and impact of errors in scientific publications (e.g., analytic inconsistencies, statistical errors, and other objective errors)?; (6) Do error prevention workflows reduce errors?; (7) How do we encourage post-publication error correction?; (8) How does 'spin' in research communication affect stakeholder understanding and use of research evidence?; (9) Do tools to aid writing research reports increase comprehensiveness and clarity of research reports?; and (10) Is it possible to inculcate scientific values and norms related to truthful, rigorous, accurate, and comprehensive scientific reporting? Conclusion: Participants identified important and relatively unexplored questions related to improving RRT.

Existing systems are lacking in some of these respects. Here we present Scholar Plot (SP), an interface that harvests bibliographic and research funding data from online sources. SP addresses systematic biases in the collected data through nominal and normalized metrics. Eventually, SP combines synergistically these metrics in a plot form for expert appraisal, and an iconic form for broader consumption. SP's plot and iconic forms are scalable, representing equally well individual scholars and their academic units, thus contributing to consistent ranking practices across the university organizational structure.

Philosophy of science plays a role of the “think-tank” of that organism. It is a generator of the sense that connects the functions of its separate parts into a systematic unity. It can be called the consciousness of science. Metaphilosophy of science is related to philosophy of science in the same way as philosophy of science itself is related to science. Within metaphilosophy of science the propensity of philosophy of science to self-reflection is implemented. Metaphilosophy of science makes relevant the issues that relate to the philosophical significance of the processes taking place in the so-called “trading zone” (in the sense of P. Galison). These trading zone is a place where scientists, science-of-science theorists and philosophers exchange their ideas. The interaction between philosophy and metaphilosophy of science takes place in the course of a competition among various philosophical interpretations of the results received within the studies of these “trading” processes. Institutional, methodological, historical and culturological studies get a philosophical interpretation and become the source of metaphilosophical ideas. Metaphorically, one may say, that metaphilosophy of science is the self-consciousness of philosophy of science. The very idea that metaphilosophy of science is a participant of the process occurring in the “trading zone” puts an end to a meaningless pile of “metalevels” that very often characterize philosophical discussions of science. © 2019 RAS Institute of Philosophy.

Fanelli D.,26644812800,"Department of Methodology, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, United Kingdom",A theory and methodology to quantify knowledge,"This article proposes quantitative answers to meta-scientific questions including 'how much knowledge is attained by a research field?', 'how rapidly is a field making progress?', 'what is the expected reproducibility of a result?', 'how much knowledge is lost from scientific bias and misconduct?', 'what do we mean by soft science?', and 'what demarcates a pseudoscience?'. Knowledge is suggested to be a system-specific property measured by K, a quantity determined by how much of the information contained in an explanandum is compressed by an explanans, which is composed of an information 'input' and a 'theory/methodology' conditioning factor. This approach is justified on three grounds: (i) K is derived from postulating that information is finite and knowledge is information compression; (ii) K is compatible and convertible to ordinary measures of effect size and algorithmic complexity; (iii) K is physically interpretable as a measure of entropic efficiency. Moreover, the K function has useful properties that support its potential as a measure of knowledge. Examples given to illustrate the possible uses of K include: the knowledge value of proving Fermat's last theorem; the accuracy of measurements of the mass of the electron; the half life of predictions of solar eclipses; the usefulness of evolutionary models of reproductive skew; the significance of gender differences in personality; the sources of irreproducibility in psychology; the impact of scientific misconduct and questionable research practices; the knowledge value of astrology. Furthermore, measures derived from K may complement ordinary meta-analysis and may give rise to a universal classification of sciences and pseudosciences. Simple and memorable mathematical formulae that summarize the theory's key results may find practical uses in meta-research, philosophy and research policy. © 2019 The Authors.

The results, based on analyses of various educational texts and contexts-curricula/syllabuses, textbooks and pedagogic practices-and of the relations between those texts/contexts, have in general shown a reduced presence and low conceptualization of metascience. The article starts by presenting the theoretical framework of the research of the ESSA Group which was focused on the introduction of the nature of science in science education. It is mostly based on Ziman's conceptualization of metascience (1984, 2000) and on Bernstein's theorization of production and reproduction of knowledge, particularly his model of pedagogic discourse (1990, 2000) and knowledge structures (1999). This is followed by the description of a pedagogical strategy, theoretically grounded, which explores the nature of science in the classroom context. The intention is to give an example of a strategy which privileges a high level learning for all students and which may contribute to a reflection about the inclusion of the nature of science on science education. Finally, considerations are made about the applicability of the strategy on the basis of previous theoretical and empirical arguments which sustain its use in the context of science education. © 2018 Praxis Educativa.

Caamaño-Alegre M.,32067540000,"Department of Philosophy, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain",Drift Theory and Plate Tectonics: A Case of Embedding in Geology,"The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the semantic relation between continental drift and plate tectonics. The numerous attempts to account for this case in either Kuhnian or Lakatosian terms have been convincingly dismissed by Rachel Laudan (PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association. Symposia and Invited Papers, 1978), who nevertheless acknowledged that there was not yet a plausible alternative to explain the so called “geological revolution”. Several decades later, the epistemological side of this revolution has received much attention (Ruse in The darwinian paradigm, essays on its history, philosophy and religious implications. London, Routledge, 1981/1989; Thagard in Conceptual revolutions. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1992; Marvin in Metascience 10:208–217, 2001; Oreskes in Plate tectonics: an insiders’ history of the modern theory of the earth. Westview Press, Boulder, 2003), while the semantic relation between drift theory and plate tectonics has remained mainly unexplored. In studying this case under a new light, the notion of embedding, as distinguished from other sorts of intertheoretical relations (Moulines in Cognitio Humana—Dynamik des Wissens und der Werte. XVII, Institut für Philosophie der Universität Leipzig, Leipzig, 1996, Time, chance, and reduction: philosophical aspects of statistical mechanics. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2010, Metatheoria 1(2):11–27, 2011), will have a particular significance. After formally analyzing the relationship between continental drift and plate tectonics, it will become evident that the models of drift theory are part of the models of plate tectonics, thereby fulfilling the conditions for embedding. All theoretical concepts from drift theory are presupposed in some theoretical concepts from plate tectonics, and all empirical concepts of the former are shared by the latter. Furthermore, all the successful paradigmatic applications of continental drift are also successful applications of plate tectonics. As a consequence, under the label “geological revolution”, we actually find a salient historical case of cumulative progress across theory change. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Continental drift; Embedding; Geological revolution; Partial substructures; Plate tectonics,Foundations of Science,Article,2018,1,NA,English,10.1007/s10699-016-9505-8

He will particularly focus on the tough problem of the relationship space-matter, in order to settle the decisive question about the possibility of keeping a transcendental approach in the light of quantum gravity.

Participating scientists accurately predicted the direction of both the evaluative and explanatory differences, but at the same time significantly overestimated both effect sizes.

Higher education institutions aim to equip new generations of students with skills and expertise relevant to workforce participation for decades to come, but their offerings sometimes misalign with commercial needs and new techniques forged at the frontiers of research. Here, we analyze and visualize the dynamic skill (mis-) alignment between academic push, industry pull, and educational offerings, paying special attention to the rapidly emerging areas of data science and data engineering (DS/DE). The visualizations and computational models presented here can help key decision makers understand the evolving structure of skills so that they can craft educational programs that serve workforce needs. Our study uses millions of publications, course syllabi, and job advertisements published between 2010 and 2016. We show how courses mediate between research and jobs. We also discover responsiveness in the academic, educational, and industrial system in how skill demands from industry are as likely to drive skill attention in research as the converse. Finally, we reveal the increasing importance of uniquely human skills, such as communication, negotiation, and persuasion. These skills are currently underexamined in research and undersupplied through education for the labor market. In an increasingly data-driven economy, the demand for “soft” social skills, like teamwork and communication, increase with greater demand for “hard” technical skills and tools. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

From a post positivist conception of scientific research in education, the matter is addressed in the general context of the current debate about science, its reliability, robustness and reproducibility. Theoretically and conceptually, the study adopts a metaresearch approach. From a methodological perspective, a review of the literature on the subject is carried out that allows a reasoned reflection on the status quo of scientific practices. This is done by considering some of the most relevant papers published in recent years on meta-science in general, and in the field of Education and Behavioral Sciences. In the first place, the so-called crisis of science is characterized, and particularly the presence of biases and questionable research practices in scientific research. Below are some of the key corrective elements proposed to strengthen and enable a more effective advancement of the scientific enterprise. These include: alternative and “new” emphasis on the statistical analysis of scientific data; renewed impetus to replication and reproducibility; and new modes of production, dissemination and assessment of research associated with open science. The article closes with some reflections regarding possible challenges for Spanish educational research in the next decade. The conclusions are organized around four axes: the development of meta-research studies; training, information and awareness-raising of researchers about questionable research practices; updating editorial policies; and the role of funders and evaluators of scientific production. © 2018, Ministry Education and Science.

Despite decades of policies in gender equity in science, disparities persist along several dimensions. One dimension that has been relatively understudied is the role of funding on gender disparities in science. To address this gap, we provide an historical analysis (1981-2016) of funding, by gender, from the National Science Foundation in the United States. We find that the mean rate of funds received by women is higher than that of men (and has been so since the early 2000s). However, men control the dominant share of funding and fellowships. As a work-in-progress paper, we discuss the extraction and cleaning of the data, provide an initial analysis, and describe the ongoing analysis of these data. The results provide policy makers with a much needed historical lens on progress towards parity, identifying areas of success and areas which require additional efforts in order to fund women at rates equal to their participation in science.",Funding; Gender; Science of science; Science policy and research assessment,"ISSI 2017 - 16th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, Conference Proceedings",Conference paper,2017,1,NA,English,NA

This is a potential concern if the large number of older scientists crowds out younger scientists, making it difficult for them to establish independent careers. In addition, scientists are believed to be most creative earlier in their careers, so the aging of the workforce may slow the pace of scientific progress. We develop and simulate a demographic model, which shows that a substantial majority of recent aging is a result of the aging of the large baby boom cohort of scientists. However, changes in behavior have also played a significant role, in particular, a decline in the retirement rate of older scientists, induced in part by the elimination of mandatory retirement in universities in 1994. Furthermore, the age distribution of the scientific workforce is still adjusting. Current retirement rates and other determinants of employment in science imply a steady-state mean age 2.3 y higher than the 2008 level of 48.6. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Yet whether globalization and advances in virtual communication technologies have altered the impact of researcher mobility is a relevant and open question that we address by analysing a broad international set of 26 170 physicists from 1980 to 2009, focusing on the 10-year period centred around each mobility event to assess the impact of mobility on research outcomes. We account for secular globalization trends by splitting the analysis into three periods, measuring for each period the effect of mobility on researchers' citation impact, research topic diversity, collaboration networks and geographical coordination. In order to identify causal effects we leverage statistical matching methods that pair mobile researchers with non-mobile researchers that are similar in research profile attributes prior the mobility event. We find that mobile researchers gain up to a 17% increase in citations relative to their non-mobile counterparts, which can be explained by the simultaneous increase in their diversity of co-authors, topics and geographical coordination in the period immediately following migration. Nevertheless, we also observe that researcher's completely curtail prior collaborations with their source country in 11% of the cross-border mobility events. As such, these individual-level perturbations fuel multiscale churning in scientific networks, e.g. rewiring the connectivity of individuals and ideas and affecting international integration. Together these results provide additional clarity on the complex relationship between human capital mobility and the dynamics of social capital investment, with implications for immigration and national innovation system policy. © 2018 The Authors.",diversity; human mobility; network science; propensity score matching; researcher careers; science of science,Journal of the Royal Society Interface,Article,2018,58,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,English,10.1098/rsif.2018.0580

In such a complex environment, the participation of authors became more specialized, hampering the task of evaluating authors according to their contributions. While some metrics were adapted to account for the order (or rank) of authors in a paper, many journals are now requiring a description of their specific roles in the publication. Surprisingly, the investigation of the relationships between credited contributions and author's rank has been limited to a few studies. Here we analyzed such a kind of data and show, quantitatively, that the regularity in the authorship contributions decreases with the number of authors in a paper. Furthermore, we found that the rank of authors and their roles in papers follow three general patterns according to the nature of their contributions: (i) the total contribution increases with author's rank; (ii) the total contribution decreases with author's rank; and (iii) the total contribution is symmetric, with most of contributions being performed by first and last authors. This was accomplished by collecting and analyzing the data retrieved from PLoS One and by devising a measurement of the effective number of authors in a paper. The analysis of such patterns confirms that some aspects of the author ranking are in accordance with the expected convention, such as the first and last authors being more likely to contribute more diversely in a scientific work. Conversely, such analysis also revealed that authors in the intermediary positions of the rank contribute more in specific roles, such as collecting data. This indicates that the an unbiased evaluation of researchers must take into account the distinct types of scientific contributions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Authorship contributions; Entropy; Science of science; Text mining,Journal of Informetrics,Article,2017,64,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.joi.2017.03.003

For others, understanding controversies is less instrumental but instead useful in explicating the ways in which science is embedded in society. Adapting the latter tradition to the science of science communication requires drawing insights from case studies that highlight historical and contextual factors but that may lack the predictive power sought by those who would manage controversy. Some recurring themes in the controversy literature include technical efficiency versus social equity, regulation versus freedom of choice, progress versus traditional values, and political priorities versus environmental sustainability.

This assessment includes a look at the co-authorship, patterns of co-writing, researchers' outputs, authors ranking, map drawing of the co-authorship network, comparing the network of cowriting of the medical field with other domains, main component and key researchers, review The fit of the network of the co-writing of medical researchers with the small world theory, as well as person-centered indicators such as degree centrality, between centrality, closeness centrality Eigenvector, vector centrality, beta centrality, and interstitial centrality. Method: This research was carried out using scientific methods and network analysis techniques. The statistical population of this research is all articles of the faculty members and other researchers of Kerman University of Medical Sciences, indexed at the ISI database (the Science of Science Web site) during the period from 1978 to 2015, which consists of 1710 articles. The data were analyzed by Bibexcel, Histcite and Net drive softwares after pre-processing. Findings: The review of the articles showed that the pattern of four and five writers had the highest percentage of the co-written articles. The co-authorship network of this university is lower un an index such as the number of papers for each author from many other areas, and in the index of authors for each article is higher than most of the areas. The density index of this network is 0/003, its clustering coefficient is 0/64 and the percentage of the co-written articles in companion with the single-written articles is 97%. The researchers of this university have a high degree of collaboration in writing their articles, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Shahid Bahonar Kerman University and Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, and the United States, Australia and England have the most scientific cooperation with Kerman University of Medical Sciences. Studies show that most of the articles published at Kerman University of Medical Sciences have been produced by a small number of researchers of this university, and the ratio of national-to-international collaboration at this university has been. 2/9. Conclusion: The co-authorship network of the researchers of this university is characterized by the average length trajectory and relatively high clustering coefficient, which is a small world network. The study of the distribution of the degree centrality of the central and key researchers of the network shows that the principle of ""success breeds success"", which was proposed by Age and Rousseau in 1996, is also valid in the surveyed network, and the researchers with high centrality play a very important role in the development and The evolution of co-writing networks. © 2018 University of Idaho Library.",Aggregate approach; Author fertility law; Centrality measures; Co-authorship; Lotka law; Person-centered approach,Library Philosophy and Practice,Article,2018,0,NA,English,NA

A Log-Normal distribution function is the normal distribution for the logarithm of the variable. In linear scale it is a highly skewed distribution with a long tail in the high productivity side. We are still lacking a detailed and convincing ab-initio model able to explain observed Log-Normal distributions—this is the gap this paper sets out to fill. Here, we propose a general explanation of the observed evidence by developing a straightforward model based on the following simple assumptions: (1) the materialist principle of the natural equality of human intelligence, (2) the success breeds success effect, also known as Merton effect, which can be traced back to the Gospel parables about the Talents (Matthew) and Minas (Luke), and, (3) the recognition and reputation mechanism. Building on these assumptions we propose a distribution function that, although mathematically not identical to a Log-Normal distribution, shares with it all its main features. Our model well reproduces the empirical distributions, so the hypotheses at the basis of the model are not falsified. Therefore the distributions of the bibliometric parameters observed might be the result of chance and noise (chaos) related to multiplicative phenomena connected to a publish or perish inflationary mechanism, led by scholars’ recognition and reputations. In short, being a scholar in the right tail or in the left tail of the distribution could have very little connection to her/his merit and achievements. This interpretation might cast some doubts on the use of the number of papers and/or citations as a measure of scientific achievements. A tricky issue seems to emerge, that is: what then do bibliometric indicators really measure? This issue calls for deeper investigations into the meaning of bibliometric indicators. This is an interesting and intriguing topic for further research to be carried out within a wider interdisciplinary investigation of the science of science, which may include elements and investigation tools from philosophy, psychology and sociology. © 2017, The Author(s).",NA,Palgrave Communications,Article,2017,24,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1057/palcomms.2017.64

Office, 1 Research Road, Ridge, 11961-2701, NY, United States",Impact Factors and the Central Limit Theorem: Why citation averages are scale dependent,"Citation averages, and Impact Factors (IFs) in particular, are sensitive to sample size. Here, we apply the Central Limit Theorem to IFs to understand their scale-dependent behavior. For a journal of n randomly selected papers from a population of all papers, we expect from the Theorem that its IF fluctuates around the population average μ, and spans a range of values proportional to                                  , where σ2 is the variance of the population's citation distribution. The                                   dependence has profound implications for IF rankings: The larger a journal, the narrower the range around μ where its IF lies. IF rankings therefore allocate an unfair advantage to smaller journals in the high IF ranks, and to larger journals in the low IF ranks. As a result, we expect a scale-dependent stratification of journals in IF rankings, whereby small journals occupy the top, middle, and bottom ranks; mid-sized journals occupy the middle ranks; and very large journals have IFs that asymptotically approach μ. We obtain qualitative and quantitative confirmation of these predictions by analyzing (i) the complete set of 166,498 IF & journal-size data pairs in the 1997-2016 Journal Citation Reports of Clarivate Analytics, (ii) the top-cited portion of 276,000 physics papers published in 2014-2015, and (iii) the citation distributions of an arbitrarily sampled list of physics journals. We conclude that the Central Limit Theorem is a good predictor of the IF range of actual journals, while sustained deviations from its predictions are a mark of true, non-random, citation impact. IF rankings are thus misleading unless one compares like-sized journals or adjusts for these effects. We propose the Φ index, a rescaled IF that accounts for size effects, and which can be readily generalized to account also for different citation practices across research fields. Our methodology applies to other citation averages that are used to compare research fields, university departments or countries in various types of rankings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead, science communicators must learn to navigate both the cultural implications of their work and the heuristics audiences use when deciding whom to trust. Consideration must be given to scientific knowledge and the audience’s values alike. A science of science communication provides an understanding of these multiple considerations and promotes effective dialogue between scientists and the public. © Oxford University Press 2017.",Biases; Complexity; Heuristics; Media; Science communication; Values,The Oxford Handbook of the Science of Science Communication,Book chapter,2017,1,NA,English,10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190497620.013.8

I argue that the doctrine can be given both an ontological and a causal interpretation, and that the causal aspect of the doctrine is especially significant for Jackson and his contemporaries.

But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data ('analytic reproducibility'). To investigate this, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25% pre-policy to 136/174, 78% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/104, 22% pre-policy to 85/136, 62%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly, there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings. © 2018 The Authors.",Interrupted time series; Journal policy; Meta-science; Open data; Open science; Reproducibility,Royal Society Open Science,Article,2018,185,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1098/rsos.180448

While collaboration and citation networks highlight important contributions within the field, the roles of and relations among specific areas of study can remain quite opaque. Here, we apply techniques from network science to map the landscape of neuroimaging research documented in the journal NeuroImage over the past decade. We create a network in which nodes represent research topics, and edges give the degree to which these topics tend to be covered in tandem. The network displays small-world architecture, with communities characterized by common imaging modalities and medical applications, and with hubs that integrate these distinct subfields. Using node-level analysis, we quantify the structural roles of individual topics within the neuroimaging landscape, and find high levels of clustering within the structural MRI subfield as well as increasing participation among topics related to psychiatry. The overall prevalence of a topic is unrelated to the prevalence of its neighbors, but the degree to which a topic becomes more or less popular over time is strongly related to changes in the prevalence of its neighbors. Finally, we incorporate data from PNAS to investigate whether it serves as a trend-setter for topics’ use within NeuroImage. We find that popularity trends are correlated across the two journals, and that changes in popularity tend to occur earlier within PNAS among growing topics.

However, most dense subgraph discovery algorithms are designed for classic, unipartite graphs. Subsequently, studies on affiliation networks are conducted on the co-occurrence graphs (e.g., co-author and co-purchase) that project the bipartite structure to a unipartite structure by connecting two entities if they share an affiliation. Despite their convenience, co-occurrence networks come at a cost of loss of information and an explosion in graph sizes, which limit the quality and the efficiency of solutions. We study the dense subgraph discovery problem on bipartite graphs. We define a framework of bipartite subgraphs based on the butterfly motif (2,2-biclique) to model the dense regions in a hierarchical structure. We introduce efficient peeling algorithms to find the dense subgraphs and build relations among them. We can identify denser structures compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms on co-occurrence graphs in real-world data.

Specifically, it probes the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and policy—urban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of STS is adopted, which supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape, socio–cultural and politico–institutional structures. In addition, the study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation, productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments. This form of S&T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Computing; Discourse; Ecologically and technologically advanced societies; ICT; Innovation; S&T; Smart sustainable cities; Social construction; Socio-technical; Techno-urban; Urban sustainability,Sustainable Cities and Society,Article,2017,221,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.scs.2016.11.004

Inductive claims, concerning what will tend to happen, based on what has been observed as tending to happen, have a place within this realist theory of science. A good inductive inference, especially one backed up by a range of other methods and evidence, will tend to get it right. But if that insecurity matches accurately the tendential nature of the world, then it can hardly be a criticism of induction. Instead of individual powers, singularly directed towards their manifestations, the framework of laws is distinctive for its generality of scope. The claim should be taken as an attribution of a tendential nature rather than a contrived absolute regularity.

As empirical results have begun to enhance our understanding of consciousness, it is important to find out whether other factors, such as funding for consciousness research and status of consciousness scientists, provide a suitable environment for the field to grow and develop sustainably. We conducted an online survey on people's views regarding various aspects of the scientific study of consciousness as a field of research. 249 participants completed the survey, among which 80% were in academia, and around 40% were experts in consciousness research. Topics covered include the progress made by the field, funding for consciousness research, job opportunities for consciousness researchers, and the scientific rigor of the work done by researchers in the field. The majority of respondents (78%) indicated that scientific research on consciousness has been making progress. However, most participants perceived obtaining funding and getting a job in the field of consciousness research as more difficult than in other subfields of neuroscience. Overall, work done in consciousness research was perceived to be less rigorous than other neuroscience subfields, but this perceived lack of rigor was not related to the perceived difficulty in finding jobs and obtaining funding. Lastly, we found that, overall, the global workspace theory was perceived to be the most promising (around 28%), while most non-expert researchers (around 22% of non-experts) found the integrated information theory (IIT) most promising. We believe the survey results provide an interesting picture of current opinions from scientists and researchers about the progresses made and the challenges faced by consciousness research as an independent field.

We examine the growth dynamics and interlocking relationships found in the worldwide scientific prize network. We focus on understanding how the knowledge linkages among prizes and scientists’ propensities for prizewinning relate to knowledge pathways between disciplines and stratification within disciplines. Our data cover more than 3,000 different scientific prizes in diverse disciplines and the career histories of 10,455 prizewinners worldwide for over 100 years. We find several key links between prizes and scientific advances. First, despite an explosive proliferation of prizes over time and across the globe, prizes are more concentrated within a relatively small group of scientific elites, and ties among elites are highly clustered, suggesting that a relatively constrained number of ideas and scholars push the boundaries of science. For example, 64.1% of prizewinners have won two prizes and 13.7% have won five or more prizes. Second, certain prizes strongly interlock disciplines and subdisciplines, creating key pathways by which knowledge spreads and is recognized across science. Third, genealogical and coauthorship networks predict who wins multiple prizes, which helps to explain the interconnectedness among celebrated scientists and their pathbreaking ideas. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

Methods: A philosophical methodology is used, based on novel and classical philosophical reflection upon existent literature, clinical wisdoms and narrative theory to discover a meta-science and telos of humankind for the development of a relevant and defendable global biomedical bioethics. Results: In this article, through pondering an integrative systems approach, I propose a biomedical model that may provide Western biomedicine with leadership and interesting insight into the unity beyond the artificial boundaries of its traditional divisions and the limit between physiological and pathological situations (health and disease). A unified biomedicine, as scientific foundation, might then provide the basis for dissolution of similar reflected boundaries within bioethics. A principled and communitarian cosmopolitan bioethics may then be synonymous with a recently proposed principled and communitarian cosmopolitan neuroethics based on a novel objective meta-ethics. In an attempt to help facilitate equal and inclusive participation in inter-, multi-, and transdisciplinary intercultural discourse regarding the aforementioned international governance issues, I offer: (1) a meta-science derived through considering the general behaviour of activity, plasticity and balance in biology and; (2) a novel thought framework to encourage and enhance the ability for self-evaluation, self-criticism, and self-revision aimed at broadening perspective, as well as acknowledging and responding to the strengths and limitations of extant knowledge. Conclusions: Through classical philosophical reflection, I evolve a theory of medicine to discover a telos of humankind which in turn provides an 'internal' moral grounding for a proposed global biomedical bioethics. © 2017 The Author(s).",Communitarian cosmopolitan; Digital biomedicine; Discernment continuum; Global bioethics; Global biomedicine; Global systemic shift; Integrative biomedicine; Meta-science; Neuroethics; Telos of humankind,"Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine",Article,2017,2,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1186/s13010-017-0051-y

These cross-citations tend to focus on highly cited papers, and we observe a positive correlation between the numbers of citations a study receives within and across categories. We find evidence that reviews can function as integrators between the two literatures, argue that theoretical models are analogous to specific empirical study systems, and complement our analyses by studying a cocitation network.

ADNI research literature has increased substantially over the past decade, which poses challenges for effectively communicating information about the results and impact of ADNI-related studies. In this work, we employed advanced information visualization techniques to perform a comprehensive and systematic mapping of the ADNI scientific growth and impact over a period of 12 years. Methods: Citation information of ADNI-related publications from 01/01/2003 to 05/12/2015 were downloaded from the Scopus database. Five fields, including authors, years, affiliations, sources (journals), and keywords, were extracted and preprocessed. Statistical analyses were performed on basic publication data as well as journal and citations information. Science mapping workflows were conducted using the Science of Science (Sci2) Tool to generate geospatial, topical, and collaboration visualizations at the micro (individual) to macro (global) levels such as geospatial layouts of institutional collaboration networks, keyword co-occurrence networks, and author collaboration networks evolving over time. Results: During the studied period, 996 ADNI manuscripts were published across 233 journals and conference proceedings. The number of publications grew linearly from 2008 to 2015, so did the number of involved institutions. ADNI publications received much more citations than typical papers from the same set of journals. Collaborations were visualized at multiple levels, including authors, institutions, and research areas. The evolution of key ADNI research topics was also plotted over the studied period. Conclusions: Both statistical and visualization results demonstrate the increasing attention of ADNI research, strong citation impact of ADNI publications, the expanding collaboration networks among researchers, institutions and ADNI core areas, and the dynamic evolution of ADNI research topics. The visualizations presented here can help improve daily decision making based on a deep understanding of existing patterns and trends using proven and replicable data analysis and visualization methods. They have great potential to provide new insights and actionable knowledge for helping translational research in AD. © 2017 Yao et al.

Empirical evidence reveals that little is known about the dynamic aspects of human knowledge. Precise dissection of the expansion of scientific knowledge could help us to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of science. In this paper, we analyzed the dynamic properties and growth principles of the MEDLINE bibliographic database using network analysis methodology. The basic assumption of this work is that the scientific evolution of the life sciences can be represented as a list of co-occurrences of MeSH descriptors that are linked to MEDLINE citations. The MEDLINE database was summarized as a complex system, consisting of nodes and edges, where the nodes refer to knowledge concepts and the edges symbolize corresponding relations. We performed an extensive statistical evaluation based on more than 25 million citations in the MEDLINE database, from 1966 until 2014. We based our analysis on node and community level in order to track temporal evolution in the network. The degree distribution of the network follows a stretched exponential distribution which prevents the creation of large hubs. Results showed that the appearance of new MeSH terms does not also imply new connections. The majority of new connections among nodes results from old MeSH descriptors. We suggest a wiring mechanism based on the theory of structural holes, according to which a novel scientific discovery is established when a connection is built among two or more previously disconnected parts of scientific knowledge. Overall, we extracted 142 different evolving communities. It is evident that new communities are constantly born, live for some time, and then die. We also provide a Web-based application that helps characterize and understand the content of extracted communities. This study clearly shows that the evolution of MEDLINE knowledge correlates with the network's structural and temporal characteristics. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Bibliographic databases; Complex networks; MEDLINE; Network evolution; Science of science,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,Article,2019,8,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,English,10.1016/j.jbi.2018.11.014

Influence is multifaceted, and citations reveal only part of it. Citation counts exhibit preferential attachment and follow a rigid “news cycle” that can miss sustained and indirect forms of influence. Building on dynamic topic models that track distributional shifts in discourse over time, we introduce a variant that incorporates features, such as authorship, affiliation, and publication venue, to assess how these contexts interact with content to shape future scholarship. We perform in-depth analyses on collections of physics research (500,000 abstracts; 102 years) and scholarship generally (JSTOR repository: 2 million full-text articles; 130 years). Our measure of document influence helps predict citations and shows how outcomes, such as winning a Nobel Prize or affiliation with a highly ranked institution, boost influence. Analysis of citations alongside discursive influence reveals that citations tend to credit authors who persist in their fields over time and discount credit for works that are influential over many topics or are “ahead of their time.” In this way, our measures provide a way to acknowledge diverse contributions that take longer and travel farther to achieve scholarly appreciation, enabling us to correct citation biases and enhance sensitivity to the full spectrum of scholarly impact. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

The issue of pluralism has been considered in relation to the position of Lublin's philosopher of science, Zygmunt Hajduk. It is argued that a pluralistic approach to science and philosophy of science has been quite prominent in his reflection since the beginning of his career. The aim of the article is an attempt to characterize and interpret Hajduk's position on pluralism. This aim has been carried out in several stages. Firstly, the historical background of the problem field has been sketched. Then a number of kinds of pluralism has been distinguished and own proposal of typology has been put forward (in reference to Hajduk's works). This proposal presents a model of three levels of analysis of science: level of scientific theories, methodological and meta-methodological level. On every of these levels pluralism plays an important role. Thirdly, this model has been applied to the analysis of Hajduk's position in regard to pluralism in science and metascience. Lastly, referring to the work and ideas of Paul Feyerabend, an interpretation of Hajduk's position has been presented and designated as ""good empiricist"". © John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin Faculty of Philosophy.

The building blocks of science, such as scientific terms, laws, problems, solutions, theories and disciplines are traditionally represented as single, atomic nodes in scientific ontologies. This makes it difficult to distinguish those constituents and use them properly in the automation of scientific activities. We support the idea of adding structure to the representation of different constituents of science corpus. The structure of a scientific law, for instance, would be different from that of a solution to a given scientific problem. It is shown through examples that considering those different structures can help in reasoning about scientific knowledge. Moreover, the domain- independent aspects of different constituents of science have the potential to be factored out in a meta-ontology.

De Bruin and Moed (1993) suggested that ""corporate address words"" or word co-occurrence in affiliation field could be used. In science, researchers construct knowledge through neologisms. Studies of new scientific concepts indicated us new trends on naming institutions with neologisms. Therefore, one can postulate that neologisms are markers of emerging scientific field, and naming institution after neologisms could be part of a legitimation process. The aim of this paper is to explore this hypothesis through the bibliometric analysis of one case study related to the diffusion process of the concept of ""interventional radiology"" (IR). The study of the history of IR concept and its trends using affiliation addresses allows us to better understand how IR field has attempted to institutionalize and to gain its autonomy. Several institutions publishing in the field of IR have undertaken a legitimization process by entitling department ""interventional radiology"", but the specialty has partially or internationally failed to gain its scientific autonomy. In conclusion, measuring the trend of newly named institutions after a neologism can be used to assess the degree of institutionalization for a new medical or scientific field.",Science of science,"ISSI 2017 - 16th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, Conference Proceedings",Conference paper,2017,1,NA,English,NA

On the one hand, critics of disciplinary research and education have argued that disciplines are isolated silos, within which specialists pursue inward-looking and increasingly narrow research agendas. On the other hand, critics of the silo argument have demonstrated that researchers constantly import and export ideas across disciplinary boundaries. These perspectives have different implications for how knowledge diffuses, how intellectuals gain and lose status within their disciplines, and how intellectual reputations evolve within and across disciplines. We argue that highly general claims about the nature of disciplinary boundaries are counterproductive, and that research on the nature of specific disciplinary boundaries is more useful. To that end, this paper uses a novel publication and citation network dataset and statistical models of citation networks to test hypotheses about the boundaries between philosophy of science and 11 disciplinary clusters. Specifically, we test hypotheses about whether engaging with and being cited by scientific communities outside philosophy of science has an impact on one’s position within philosophy of science. Our results suggest that philosophers of science produce interdisciplinary scholarship, but they tend not to cite work by other philosophers when it is published in journals outside of their discipline. Furthermore, net of other factors, receiving citations from other disciplines has no meaningful impact—positive or negative—on citations within philosophy of science. We conclude by considering this evidence for simultaneous interdisciplinarity and insularity in terms of scientific trading theory and other work on disciplinary boundaries and communication. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Citations; Diffusion; Disciplines; Exponential random graph models; Intellectual networks; Philosophy of science; Science of science; Sociology of science,Scientometrics,Article,2018,33,NA,English,10.1007/s11192-018-2866-8

These acts of science communication are often evaluated in terms of their ability to inform (i.e., introduce accurate and accessible information) and engage (i.e., capture interest and maintain attention). We focus on a third basis by which science communication might be judged, influence. Science communicators exert influence when they shape public opinions in ways that affect their judgments and decisions, alter social and political discourse and debate, and guide social policy. We describe how the influence of any given science communication should be evaluated independent of its ability to inform or engage. We give particular attention in our analysis to the often unintended influences that well-meaning science communicators can have. We begin by considering ways that communications from climate scientists might reduce support for climate regulation and communications from health scientists might undermine public health. We then develop two “case studies,” drawn from social psychology. These show how popular media descriptions of the science of racial bias and disadvantage might in some cases exacerbate racial discrimination and reduce concern for the disadvantaged. We close with an agenda for a more vigorous science of science communication; one that engages in two complementary pursuits. Critical studies identify the dominant and consequential effects that popular science communicators are having on public perceptions. Strategic studies advance and empirically test communication strategies that scientists can pursue to reduce—rather than exacerbate—social problems. © 2018 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues",NA,Social Issues and Policy Review,Article,2019,13,NA,English,10.1111/sipr.12055

A Description of Researchers’ Rationales,"In response to the replication crisis, many psychologists recommended that the field adopt several proposed reforms to research practices, such as preregistration, to make research more replicable. However, how researchers have received these proposals is not well known because, to our knowledge, no systematic investigation into use of these reforms has been conducted. We wanted to learn about the rationales researchers have for not adopting the proposed reforms. We analyzed survey data of 1,035 researchers in social and personality psychology who were asked to indicate whether they thought it was acceptable to not follow four specific proposed reforms and to explain their reasoning when they thought it was acceptable to not adopt these reforms. The four reforms were preregistering hypotheses and methods, making data publicly available online, conducting formal power analyses, and reporting effect sizes. Our results suggest that (a) researchers have adopted some of the proposed reforms (e.g., reporting effect sizes) more than others (e.g., preregistering studies) and (b) rationales for not adopting them reflect a need for more discussion and education about their utility and feasibility. © The Author(s) 2018.",metascience; methodology; open materials; questionable research practices; replicability; research practices,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,Article,2018,42,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1177/2515245918757427

There are growing demands and aspirations to measure research impact (beyond academic publications), to understand how science works, and to optimise its societal and economic impact. In response, a multidisciplinary practice called research impact assessment is rapidly developing. Given that the practice is still in its formative stage, systematised recommendations or accepted standards for practitioners (such as funders and those responsible for managing research projects) across countries or disciplines to guide research impact assessment are not yet available. In this statement, we propose initial guidelines for a rigorous and effective process of research impact assessment applicable to all research disciplines and oriented towards practice. This statement systematises expert knowledge and practitioner experience from designing and delivering the International School on Research Impact Assessment (ISRIA). It brings together insights from over 450 experts and practitioners from 34 countries, who participated in the school during its 5-year run (from 2013 to 2017) and shares a set of core values from the school's learning programme. These insights are distilled into ten-point guidelines, which relate to (1) context, (2) purpose, (3) stakeholders' needs, (4) stakeholder engagement, (5) conceptual frameworks, (6) methods and data sources, (7) indicators and metrics, (8) ethics and conflicts of interest, (9) communication, and (10) community of practice. The guidelines can help practitioners improve and standardise the process of research impact assessment, but they are by no means exhaustive and require evaluation and continuous improvement. The prima facie effectiveness of the guidelines is based on the systematised expert and practitioner knowledge of the school's faculty and participants derived from their practical experience and research evidence. The current knowledge base has gaps in terms of the geographical and scientific discipline as well as stakeholder coverage and representation. The guidelines can be further strengthened through evaluation and continuous improvement by the global research impact assessment community. © 2018 The Author(s).",Evaluation; Guidelines; International School on Research Impact Assessment (ISRIA); Research impact assessment; Responsible research and innovation; Science of science; Science policy,Health Research Policy and Systems,Article,2018,58,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1186/s12961-018-0281-5

Despite the long-standing interests and its broad impact, we lack systematic answers to this simple yet fundamental question. By reviewing and classifying prior studies for the past 50 years, we find a significant lack of consensus in the literature, primarily due to the coexistence of retrospective and prospective approaches to measuring citation age distributions. These two approaches have been pursued in parallel, lacking any known connections between the two. Here we developed a new theoretical framework that not only allows us to connect the two approaches through precise mathematical relationships, it also helps us reconcile the interplay between temporal decay of citations and the growth of science, helping us uncover new functional forms characterizing citation age distributions. We find retrospective distribution follows a lognormal distribution with exponential cutoff, while prospective distribution is governed by the interplay between a lognormal distribution and the growth in the number of references. Most interestingly, the two approaches can be connected once rescaled by the growth of publications and citations. We further validate our framework using both large-scale citation datasets and analytical models capturing citation dynamics. Together this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the time dimension of science, representing a new empirical and theoretical basis for all future studies in this area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",NA,Journal of Informetrics,Article,2017,33,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1016/j.joi.2017.04.002

In this work, we study the evolution of scientific development over the past century by presenting an anatomy of 89 million digitalized papers published between 1900 and 2015. We find that science has benefited from the shift from individual work to collaborative effort, with over 90% of the world-leading innovations generated by collaborations in this century, nearly four times higher than they were in the 1900s. We discover that rather than the frequent myopic-and self-referencing that was common in the early 20 century, modern scientists instead tend to look for literature further back and farther around. Finally, we also observe the globalization of scientific development from 1900 to 2015, including 25-fold and 7-fold increases in international collaborations and citations, respectively, as well as a dramatic decline in the dominant accumulation of citations by the US, the UK, and Germany, from ∼95% to ∼50% over the same period.

The cornerstone for this will be the clarification of the function of philosophy as a metascience in Greek thought, which grappled the order of things in its functional unity of macroscopic and microscopic observation of the world. This macroscopic observation was never at odds with microscopic research but was a universal science or science about scientifically knowable phenomena that is, philosophy. Despite philosophy being an activity closely linked to natural sciences, it is not a science in itself, even though it is often mistaken for such as a term. Philosophy as knowledge, or a function that leads to knowledge, is called science, but this does not make it equal to scientific disciplines. In the unity of all scientific disciplines, which are hierarchically ordered into a pyramid, philosophy always stands on top, it being a science about scientifically knowable phenomena. Out of all the scientific disciplines, philosophy is the one that leads to knowledge of first beginnings and causes. It is a general observation of reality, which secures the unity of scientifically knowable facts and phenomena. Philosophical knowledge as a ""universal science"" concentrates all partial findings into a unified whole.

We illustrate that the chaperone effect has a different magnitude for journals in different branches of science, being more pronounced in medical and biological sciences and weaker in natural sciences. Finally, we show that in the case of high-impact venues, the chaperone effect has significant implications, specifically resulting in a higher average impact relative to papers authored by new principal investigators (PIs).

Giza P.,6506257369,"Department of Logic and Cognitive Science, MCS University, Lublin, Poland",Automated discovery systems and the inductivist controversy,"The paper explores possible influences that some developments in the field of branches of AI, called automated discovery and machine learning systems, might have upon some aspects of the old debate between Francis Bacon’s inductivism and Karl Popper’s falsificationism. Donald Gillies facetiously calls this controversy ‘the duel of two English knights’, and claims, after some analysis of historical cases of discovery, that Baconian induction had been used in science very rarely, or not at all, although he argues that the situation has changed with the advent of machine learning systems. (Some clarification of terms machine learning and automated discovery is required here. The key idea of machine learning is that, given data with associated outcomes, software can be trained to make those associations in future cases which typically amounts to inducing some rules from individual cases classified by the experts. Automated discovery (also called machine discovery) deals with uncovering new knowledge that is valuable for human beings, and its key idea is that discovery is like other intellectual tasks and that the general idea of heuristic search in problem spaces applies also to discovery tasks. However, since machine learning systems discover (very low-level) regularities in data, throughout this paper I use the generic term automated discovery for both kinds of systems. I will elaborate on this later on). Gillies’s line of argument can be generalised: thanks to automated discovery systems, philosophers of science have at their disposal a new tool for empirically testing their philosophical hypotheses. Accordingly, in the paper, I will address the question, which of the two philosophical conceptions of scientific method is better vindicated in view of the successes and failures of systems developed within three major research programmes in the field: machine learning systems in the Turing tradition, normative theory of scientific discovery formulated by Herbert Simon’s group and the programme called HHNT, proposed by J. Holland, K. Holyoak, R. Nisbett and P.

NA,NA,NA,What factors are associated with more authors? A case study of Danish economics,"The number of authors is increasing in the social sciences, but co-authorship studies often explain these increases in the number of authors by referring to authorship studies in the natural or life sciences or by using anecdotal evidence. Thus, a deeper understanding of why the number of authors is increasing in most field is necessary, as well, as whether there are changes in the research or in the researchers' behavior. This study will examine the changes in research in Danish economics, and investigate to what extent these changes can be explained by external factors in the research culture.

In this paper, we argue that by theoretically embedding and operationalizing 'internationality', bibliometrics can contribute to the study of social structures of scientific communities. We consider journals as communication channels in the production process of scientific communities and define their internationality as the links they create between community members from different countries. This definition can be operationalised with four sets of variables describing the international composition of the set of authors, the selection processes and their impact on the international composition of the set of authors, the international composition of the journal's audience, and knowledge flows between authors and audiences. We analyse six journals from different regions of the world in the field of International Relations and find that the supposedly 'leading international journals' are in fact closer to being domestic US-journals, while European and Asian journals show a much higher diversity of authors, audiences and editorial boards. We confirm that a differentiated analysis of international diversity contributes to theorydriven investigations of scientific communities.

Despite demonstrating high accuracy on benchmarks, they reproduce the external classification for many real-world systems with a significant level of discrepancy. A widely accepted reason behind such outcome is the unavoidable loss of non-topological information (such as node attributes) encountered when the original complex system is converted to a network. In this article we systematically show that the observed discrepancies may also be caused by a different reason: the external classification itself. For this end we use scientific publication data which (i) exhibit a well defined modular structure and (ii) hold an expert-made classification of research articles. Having represented the articles and the extracted scientific concepts both as a bipartite network and as its unipartite projection, we applied modularity optimization to uncover the inner thematic structure. The resulting clusters are shown to partly reflect the author-made classification, although some significant discrepancies are observed. A detailed analysis of these discrepancies shows that they may carry essential information about the system, mainly related to the use of similar techniques and methods across different (sub)disciplines, that is otherwise omitted when only the external classification is considered. © 2016, Palchykov et al.",bipartite networks; community detection; science of science,EPJ Data Science,Article,2016,12,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0090-4

The tendency of smoothing of fundamental dialogic philosophy is based on certain theoretical set of west-european theoretical thought that is emerging in modern times, and can be defined as bourgeois. The logic of individualization and nulling of the history arising at the time leads to a particular form of totality of the findings from the perspective of the concrete discourse. Philosophy for its existence must be intrinsically dual and not self-identical. Homogenization of thought is its death. Only differences can create the movement of thought. That is why philosophy has always needed some form of exit from the state of sociality in existence. Being bourgeois by origin, it must find a point of outsidedness, allowing to see the totality in the form of the Absolute, to assume the possibility of development. The philosophy today can be as a sphere of free spiritual production on the assumption of building polyphonic discourse if to proceed from the idea of anthroposociogenesis as an incomplete process leading to broadening options and needs of socialized man.","A historicism; Individual social totality; Spiritual production; The opposition ""bourgeois - proletarian"" modern philosophy","Journal of Organizational Culture, Communications and Conflict",Article,2016,0,NA,English,NA

As the basis of our study, we employ an ArnetMiner dataset with more than 1.7 million authors and 2 million papers spanning over 60 years. We formally define a scientist's collaboration signature as the distribution of collaboration strengths with each collaborator in his or her academic ego network, which is quantified by four measures: sociability, dependence, diversity, and self-collaboration. We then demonstrate that the collaboration signature allows us to effectively distinguish between researchers with dissimilar levels of scientific impact. We also discover that, even from the early stages of one's researcher career, a scientist's collaboration signature can help to reveal his or her future scientific impact. Finally, we find that as a representative group of outstanding computer scientists, Turing Award winners collectively produce distinctive collaboration signatures throughout the entirety of their careers.

The objective of the current study was to analyze all publications whose titles included the term ""postmenopausal osteoporosis"" published during the past decade by journals indexed in the database of SCI-E. Methods: This paper analyzes two sets of data: in the first, all papers with ""postmenopausal osteoporosis"" in their titles indexed in the database of SCI-E in the period 2001-2011; the second, all papers published by Osteoporosis International that were indexed in SCI-E during 2001-2011. The Science of Science Tool was used to map the co-authorship networks of papers published by Osteoporosis International in 2007-2011. Only papers cited more than 100 times in the Web of Science were considered for mapping the co-authorship network. Results: A total number of 2,056 papers with ""postmenopausal osteoporosis"" in their titles were indexed in SCI-E between 2001 and 2011. The annual number of publications increased during the study period. The majority of publications came from Western Europe and North America. The number of papers published by authors based in Western Europe was about 75% greater than for North America. Conclusion: More papers on postmenopausal osteoporosis were published in Western Europe than in North America. The networks of co-authorship pointed to the strategic positions of highly cited authors from Western Europe. The top eight authors contributing the majority of papers were from Western Europe. Consequently Western Europe had greater impact than North America. © 2014 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Menopausal women; Osteoporosis; Research activity; Scientometrics,Osteoporosis International,Article,2014,13,NA,English,10.1007/s00198-013-2603-3

For example, the Reproducibility Project, a large-scale replication attempt of 100 studies published in top psychology journals found that only 39% could be unambiguously reproduced. There is a growing consensus among scientists that the lack of reproducibility in psychology and other fields stems from various methodological factors, including low statistical power, researcher's degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on publishing surprising positive results. However, there is a contentious debate about the extent to which failures to reproduce certain results might also reflect contextual differences (often termed ""hiddenmoderators"") between the original research and the replication attempt. Although psychologists have found extensive evidence that contextual factors alter behavior, some have argued that context is unlikely to influence the results of direct replications precisely because these studies use the same methods as those used in the original research. To help resolve this debate, we recoded the 100 original studies from the Reproducibility Project on the extent to which the research topic of each study was contextually sensitive. Results suggested that the contextual sensitivity of the research topic was associated with replication success, even after statistically adjusting for several methodological characteristics (e.g., statistical power, effect size). The association between contextual sensitivity and replication success did not differ across psychological subdisciplines. These results suggest that researchers, replicators, and consumers should bemindful of contextual factors that might influence a psychological process.

Scientific impact prediction,"Scientific impact plays a central role in the evaluation of the output of scholars, departments, and institutions. A widely used measure of scientific impact is citations, with a growing body of literature focused on predicting the number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness of such predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law distribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are extremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare. Given this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked by many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: ""Will this paper increase my h-index?"" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7 million authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from the premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific impact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to increase the primary author's h-index. We find that the researcher's authority on the publication topic and the venue in which the paper is published are crucial factors to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while the topic popularity and the co-authors' hindices are of surprisingly little relevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5% potential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author's h-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a self-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that it will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current h-index in five years. We conclude that our findings on the quantification of scientific impact can help researchers to expand their influence and more effectively leverage their position of ""standing on the shoulders of giants.""

The objective of this research is to understand the factors that promote and inhibit ecosystem formation and sustainment specific to scientific research software development. We have identified a set of relevant problems inhibiting sustainability in the scientific software context, including development, evolution and maintenance, as well as funding and leadership. We have collected data and used existing business, software, and innovation analysis techniques to examine the artifacts from several scientific research projects. We interviewed significant actors in select scientific ecosystems. We describe the differences between scientific software ecosystems and commercial software ecosystems, our initial results from interviews and data analysis, and we provide a set of recommendations and approaches towards handling software sustainability. Data suggests an ecosystem strategy can contribute to the survivability and sustainability of research software; however, such a strategy, which may distract from sustainability, requires thought and effort be given to establishing and nurturing the ecosystem, which in turn distract from the research mission.

On the importance of not abandoning scientific rigor when talking about science education,"Although the ""science of science communication"" usually refers to the flow of scientific knowledge from scientists to the public, scientists direct most of their communications not to the public, but instead to other scientists in their field. This paper presents a case study on this understudied type of communication: within a discipline, among its practitioners. I argue thatmany of the contentious disagreements that exist today in the field in which I conduct my research - early science education - derive from a lack of operational definitions, such that when competing claims are made for the efficacy of one type of science instruction vs. another, the arguments are hopelessly disjointed. The aim of the paper is not to resolve the current claims and counterclaims about the most effective pedagogies in science education, but rather to note that the assessment of one approach vs. the other is all too often defended on the basis of strongly held beliefs, rather than on the results of replicable experiments, designed around operational definitions of the teaching methods being investigated. A detailed example of operational definitions from my own research on elementary school science instruction is provided. In addition, the paper addresses the issue of howcasual use of labels - both within the discipline and when communicating with the public- may in-advertently ""undo"" the benefits of operational definitions.",NA,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Article,2013,21,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1073/pnas.1212738110

However, the relation between reputation and career growth of an individual remains poorly understood, despite recent proliferation of quantitative research evaluation methods. Here, we develop an original framework for measuring how a publication's citation rate Δc depends on the reputation of its central author i, in addition to its net citation count c. To estimate the strength of the reputation effect, we perform a longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450 highly cited scientists, using the total citations Ci of each scientist as his/her reputation measure. We find a citation crossover cx, which distinguishes the strength of the reputation effect. For publications with c < cx, the author's reputation is found to dominate the annual citation rate. Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage corresponding to roughly a 66% increase in the citation rate for each tenfold increase in Ci. However, the reputation effect becomes negligible for highly cited publications meaning that, for c ≥ cx, the citation rate measures scientific impact more transparently. In addition, we have developed a stochastic reputation model, which is found to reproduce numerous statistical observations for real careers, thus providing insight into the microscopic mechanisms underlying cumulative advantage in science. © 2014, National Academy of Sciences.

However, we still have limited theoretical understanding of how individual heterogeneity relates to network heterogeneity. The model presented here provides a framework linking an individual's skill set to her position in the collaboration network, and the distribution of skills in the population to the structure of the collaboration network as a whole. This model suggests that there is a non-trivial relationship between skills and network position: individuals with a useful combination of skills will have a disproportionate number of links in the network. Indeed, in some cases, an individual's degree is non-monotonic in the number of skills she has - an individual with very few skills may outperform an individual with many. Special cases of the model suggest that the degree distribution of the network will be skewed, even when the distribution of skills is uniform in the population. The degree distribution becomes more skewed as problems become more difficult, leading to a community dominated by a few high-degree superstars. This has striking implications for labor market outcomes in industries where production is largely the result of collaborative effort. © Copyright 2016 Cambridge University Press.",collaboration; degree distribution; individual heterogeneity; knowledge-based production; network formation; science of science; theoretical models,Network Science,Review,2016,2,All Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1017/nws.2015.33

Explaining creativity in scientific enterprise,"Human creativity is the ultimate driving force behind scientific progress. While the building blocks of innovations are often embodied in existing knowledge, it is creativity that blends seemingly disparate ideas. Existing studies have made striding advances in quantifying creativity of scientific publications by investigating their citation relationships. Yet, little is known hitherto about the underlying mechanisms governing scientific creative processes, largely due to that a paper's references, at best, only partially reflect its authors' actual information consumption. This work represents an initial step towards fine-grained understanding of creative processes in scientific enterprise. In specific, using two web-scale longitudinal datasets (120.1 million papers and 53.5 billion web requests spanning 4 years), we directly contrast authors' information consumption behaviors against their knowledge products. We find that, of 59.0% papers across all scientific fields, 25.7% of their creativity can be readily explained by information consumed by their authors. Further, by leveraging these findings, we develop a predictive framework that accurately identifies the most critical knowledge to fostering target scientific innovations. We believe that our framework is of fundamental importance to the study of scientific creativity. It promotes strategies to stimulate and potentially automate creative processes, and provides insights towards more effective designs of information recommendation platforms. © 2016 ACM.",Creative process; Knowledge production; Science of science,"International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings",Conference paper,2016,1,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,English,10.1145/2983323.2983820

We represent research problems as links between scientific entities in a knowledge network. We then build a generative model of discovery informed by qualitative research on scientific problem selection. We map salient features from this literature to key network properties: an entity's importance corresponds to its degree centrality, and a problem's difficulty corresponds to the network distance it spans. Drawing on millions of papers and patents published over 30 years, we use this model to infer the typical research strategy used to explore chemical relationships in biomedicine. This strategy generates conservative research choices focused on building up knowledge around important molecules. These choices become more conservative over time. The observed strategy is efficient for initial exploration of the network and supports scientific careers that require steady output, but is inefficient for science as a whole. Through supercomputer experiments on a sample of the network, we study thousands of alternatives and identify strategies much more efficient at exploring mature knowledge networks. We find that increased risk-taking and the publication of experimental failures would substantially improve the speed of discovery.

The guiding philosophical theme of this article is that, concerning actual revolutions in neuroscience over the past 60 years, Kuhn's account is wrong. There have been revolutions, and new ones are brewing, but they do not turn on competing paradigms, anomalies, or the like. Instead, they turn exclusively on the development of new experimental tools. I adopt a metascientific approach and examine in detail the development of two recent neuroscience revolutions: the impact of engineered genetically mutated mammals in the search for causal mechanisms of “higher” cognitive functions; and the more recent impact of optogenetics and designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The two key metascientific concepts, I derive from these case studies are a revolutionary new tool's motivating problem, and its initial and second-phase hook experiments. These concepts hardly exhaust a detailed metascience of tool development experiments in neuroscience, but they get that project off to a useful start and distinguish the subsequent account of neuroscience revolutions clearly from Kuhn's famous model. I close with a brief remark about the general importance of molecular biology for a current philosophical understanding of science, as comparable to the place physics occupied when Kuhn formulated his famous theory of scientific revolutions. © 2016 Bickle.",Gene targeting techniques; Hook experiments; Metascience; Motivating problem; Optogenetics and DREADDs; Thomas Kuhn’s model of scientific revolution; Tool development experiments,Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,Article,2016,33,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.3389/fnsys.2016.00024

While most researchers are personally aware of the competition implicit in the publication process, little is known about the levels of inequality at the level of individual researchers. Here we analyzed both productivity and impact measures for a large set of researchers publishing in high-impact journals, accounting for censoring biases in the publication data by using distinct researcher cohorts defined over non-overlapping time periods. For each researcher cohort we calculated Gini inequality coefficients, with average Gini values around 0.48 for total publications and 0.73 for total citations. For perspective, these observed values are well in excess of the inequality levels observed for personal income in developing countries. Investigating possible sources of this inequality, we identify two potential mechanisms that act at the level of the individual that may play defining roles in the emergence of the broad productivity and impact distributions found in science. First, we show that the average time interval between a researcher’s successive publications in top journals decreases with each subsequent publication. Second, after controlling for the time dependent features of citation distributions, we compare the citation impact of subsequent publications within a researcher’s publication record. We find that as researchers continue to publish in top journals, there is more likely to be a decreasing trend in the relative citation impact with each subsequent publication. This pattern highlights the difficulty of repeatedly producing research findings in the highest citation-impact echelon, as well as the role played by finite career and knowledge life-cycles, and the intriguing possibility that confirmation bias plays a role in the evaluation of scientific careers. © 2014 Petersen and Penner; licensee Springer.",Career growth; Citation analysis; Computational sociology; Matthew effect; Reputation; Science of science; Success premium,EPJ Data Science,Article,2014,33,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,English,10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0024-y

It is argued that two important differences between science and philosophy strongly militate against such an extension. Does this mean that there is no truth to be found in philosophy?

It situates Humanities as a subdomain of the Social and situates DH in terms of the Social and Computing domains. A relational architecture that, it is argued, can allow the systematic investigation of overlays between the domains, their disciplines and topics, is presented, as is the Metascience Expression language which can be used for the formal expression of such investigations. This article is set apart from many of the others included in this collection in two ways. Firstly, it seeks to situate, contextualise and contour digital humanities not only from the perspective of computing and/or the humanities but also with regard to the other domains and understandings of methodologies, knowledge and structures from the philosophy of science. Secondly, it proposes and draws on a comprehensive framework in order to analyse not only what DH is but also what it could be. This leads to the observation that Svensson (2010) discusses computing from the perspective of engagement; however, computing as a domain has much broader concerns including ‘theoretical results about information and its transformation, algorithms for transforming information, and a wealth of interdisciplinary topics involving interactions with one or more additional domains’. It is argued that the problems and opportunities opened up for DH as a result of the identification of this broader remit of computing remain unexplored. © 2013 Melissa Terras, Julianne Nyhan, Edward Vanhoutte and all individual authors.

Practitioners should be able to identify grossly deficient knowledge claims and clear scientific winners, but beyond this, the trick usually is to determine which scientific authority or authorities on whom to depend, a decision task that is ultimately to be tackled through the type of meta-scientific studies that Faust and Meehl have proposed. In applying scientific knowledge, the clinician usually must choose between the generalization of a scientific generalization to a particular versus the application of a clinical generalization to a particular. Determining the relative power of scientific generalizations developed outside, versus clinical generalizations developed within the setting of application, can be very difficult, and there are few established guides. A more advanced science of generalization, another meta-scientific problem, would allow sounder predictions about application to new domains and could greatly aid the practitioner. © 2013, Taylor and Francis.

Additionally, Z is less sensitive to local changes in a scientist's citation profile, namely perturbations which increase h while only marginally affecting C. Using real career data for 476 physicists careers and 488 biologist careers, we analyze both the distribution of Z and the rank stability of Z with respect to the Hirsch index h and the Egghe index g. We analyze careers distributed across a wide range of total impact, including top-cited physicists and biologists for benchmark comparison. In practice, the Z-index requires the same information needed to calculate h and could be effortlessly incorporated within career profile databases, such as Google Scholar and ResearcherID.

Briggs R.,38161173500,"Media, Culture and Creative Arts, Curtin University, Australia",The future of prediction: Speculating on William Gibson's meta-science-fiction,"Ever since famed science fiction (SF) author Ursula Le Guin insisted that SF is 'not about the future' but rather 'about the present', critics of SF narratives have largely rejected the genre's popularly held associations with the function of 'prediction'. Recent celebration of ex-cyberpunk William Gibson's Pattern Recognition as 'artistically ambitious' SF, notwithstanding its 'present-day' setting, thus appears to mark the inevitable conclusion to Le Guin's claims for the allegorical function of future-based fictions. Taken together, these events or trajectories may provide an opportunity to explore the question of the place of 'prediction' not only in contemporary SF and SF studies, but also in what Bruce Sterling has called our 'truly science-fictional world'. For in a string of largely unremarked upon novels Gibson published throughout the 1990s, the function of prediction seems displaced from the level of narration and onto particular objects and characters appearing within the novels' diegetic world. The narratives thus take on a strange kind of metafictional quality, speculating on the very activity of prediction that is sometimes imagined to define the work of SF. Examining Gibson's 'Bridge' stories with a metafictional eye to how they imagine the future of prediction, therefore, may enable us to pursue a speculative engagement with cultural discourses on futurity - thereby reconsidering not only routine denunciations of SF's predictive sheen but also the 'worldly' uses of SF's visions of the future. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Cyberpunk; Futurity; Metafiction,Textual Practice,Article,2013,6,NA,English,10.1080/0950236X.2012.738702

Thus, this review is focused on qualitative and quantitative analysis of research outputs on molecular modeling in CDs. Methods: The original data were collected from Web of Science and analyzed by scientific knowledge mapping tools, including Citespace, Science of Science, VOSviewer, GPSvisualizer and Gephi software. Scientific knowledge mapping, as an emerging approach for literature analysis, was employed to identify the knowledge structure and capture the development of the science in a visual way. Results: The results of analysis included research outputs landscape, collaboration patterns, knowledge structure and research frontiers shift with time. China had the largest contributions to the publication number in this area, while USA dominated the high quality research outputs. International collaboration between USA and Europe was much stronger than that within Asia. J American Chemical Society, as one of the most important journals, played a pivotal role in linking different research fields. Furthermore, seven important thematic clusters were identified by the research cluster analysis with visualization tools and demonstrated from three different perspectives including: (1) the mostly-used CD molecules: β-Cyclodextrin, (2) preferred modeling tools: docking calcula-tion and molecular dynamic, (3) hot research fields: structural properties, solubility, chiral recognition and solid-state inclusion complexes. Moreover, research frontier shift in the past three decades was traced by detecting keywords bursts with high citation. Conclusion: The current review provided us a macro-perspective and intellectual landscape to molecular modeling in CDs. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.",Cyclodextrin; Inclusion complexes; Knowledge map; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling,Current Pharmaceutical Design,Review,2017,21,NA,English,10.2174/1381612822666161208142617

Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing— by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ‘progeny,’ such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration.

Bustamante-Zamudio G.,53863274200,"Universidad Pedagógica Nacional Bogotá, Colombia",On the concept of field in Bourdieu; [Sobre el concepto de campo en Bourdieu],"With the concept of tension, Pierre Bourdieu gives the key tool to distinguish between the field of science and the field in which we fight for the legitimacy of science (within the world of science). Likewise, his concept of pressure is key in order to understand the relationship between society and science, the struggle for the legitimacy of science in the social world (three authors have developed such topics: Gaston Bachelard, the first, of epistemological order; Bourdieu himself, the second, of sociological order; And Jean-Francois Lyotard, the third, of a political order). However, Bourdieu oscillates between differentiating and mixing, both the tensions of each of the fields mentioned, as the opposition between tension and pressure. On the other hand, Bour-dieu allows us to think of some of the effects of the pressure exerted on science by funding bodies, industries, the State and the public: Scientometrics, leaving an 'alodoxia'; the associations and institutions, that leave a lack of research that seeks to know; and a dissemination of information that leaves a decontextualization and a reproduction of the dominant system.

Kahan D.M.,55339190700,"Yale University, United States",Climate-science communication and the measurement problem,"This article examines the science-of-science-communication measurement problem. In its simplest form, the problem reflects the use of externally invalid measures of the dynamics that generate cultural conflict over risk and other policy-relevant facts. But at a more fundamental level, the science-of-science-communication measurement problem inheres in the phenomena being measured themselves. The ""beliefs"" individuals form about a societal risk such as climate change are not of a piece; rather they reflect the distinct clusters of inferences that individuals draw as they engage information for two distinct ends: to gain access to the collective knowledge furnished by science and to enjoy the sense of identity enabled by membership in a community defined by particular cultural commitments. The article shows how appropriately designed ""science comprehension"" tests-one general and one specific to climate change-can be used to measure individuals' reasoning proficiency as collective-knowledge acquirers independently of their reasoning proficiency as cultural-identity protectors. Doing so reveals that there is in fact little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens on what science knows about climate change. The source of the climate-change controversy and like disputes over societal risks is the contamination of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status competition that make it impossible for diverse citizens to express their reason as both collective-knowledge acquirers and cultural-identity protectors at the same time. © 2015 International Society of Political Psychology.",Climate-science literacy; Evolution; Identity-protective cognition; Science literacy,Political Psychology,Article,2015,421,NA,English,10.1111/pops.12244

Ormerod argues that to recover a proper metaphysical frame to address questions around science and religion, theologians must appropriate intellectual conversion as specified by Bernard Lonergan. Such an appropriation is fully congruent with scientific method but identifies metaphysics as a form of metascience, relatively independent of the actual findings of science. Once secured, intellectual conversion provides a basis for resistance to the reductionist account of modern science and opens the door to a reappropriation of natural theology. © 2013, Theological Studies, Inc.

It is therefore important for the future of scientific practice to reflect upon the individual scientist’s ethical responsibilities within teams. To facilitate this reflection we show labor force trends in the US revealing a skewed growth in academic ranks and increased levels of competition for promotion within the system; we analyze teaming trends across disciplines and national borders demonstrating why it is becoming difficult to distribute credit and to avoid conflicts of interest; and we use more than a century of Nobel prize data to show how science is outgrowing its old institutions of singleton awards. Of particular concern within the large team environment is the weakening of the mentor–mentee relation, which undermines the cultivation of virtue ethics across scientific generations. These trends and emerging organizational complexities call for a universal set of behavioral norms that transcend team heterogeneity and hierarchy.

The phenomenon of theory deserves paying special attention because knowledge means the theories mastered by people. There is no such knowledge about subjects and objects, processes or phenomena that would not be the representation of theories. That is why the main provisions of metascience are first disclosed by the author in the present paper and following this they are applied for characterization of 15 important problematic issues of the nuclear knowledge management theory. Management of intratheoretical concepts, i.e. The principles, laws and variables, is implemented using four methods, namely, deduction, experiment, induction and correction of the original underlying principles. Management of theories is implemented by the use of three methods: problematization, innovation and interpretation. Multiplication of theory management cycles results in the generation of series of interpretative theories. Subject matter of each separate theory is exposed in the composition of the series from the viewpoint of the most well developed concept. Conclusion is made that series of interpretative theories constitute the basic element (unit) of knowledge. Significant place is occupied in the characterization of outstanding problems of nuclear knowledge management by the correlation between the articulated and practical, as well as between tacit and explicit knowledge. Mechanism is examined for implementation of the discourse leading to the development of the group knowledge.

Nevertheless, most of the metrics for assessing the vitality of science or for making funding and policy decisions are based on productivity. Similarly, the increasing level of knowledge production by large science teams, whose results often enjoy greater visibility, does not necessarily mean that ""big science"" leads to cognitive expansion. Here we present a novel, big-data method to quantify the extents of cognitive domains of different bodies of scientific literature independently from publication volume, and apply it to 20 million articles published over 60-130 years in physics, astronomy, and biomedicine. The method is based on the lexical diversity of titles of fixed quotas of research articles. Owing to large size of quotas, the method overcomes the inherent stochasticity of article titles to achieve <1% precision.

Furthermore, we show that the articles produced by larger teams cover significantly smaller cognitive territory than (the same quota of) articles from smaller teams. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role of small teams and individual researchers in expanding the cognitive boundaries of science.

Shizuteru U.,56058885100,"Japan Academy, Kyoto University, Japan",Contributions to dialogue with the Kyoto school,"""Japanese Philosophy"" in the World Since philosophers have often spoken of Greek philosophy, French philosophy, English philosophy, American philosophy, and so on, it would seem plausible to speak of ""Japanese philosophy."" Nevertheless, until about twenty or thirty years ago, philosophers in Japan generally did not take this to be a philosophically meaningful locution. It was from the beginning regarded as out of the question. If one did speak expressly of ""Japanese philosophy,"" this tended to be understood as stressing the ""Japanese"" character of the philosophy in question, and this was deemed inappropriate to the scholarly nature of philosophy as an objective and universal discipline. The universality of philosophy was implicitly understood to mean the scholarly nature of Western philosophy. When one spoke of ""philosophy"" in Japanese academia, this was understood to obviously imply ""Western philosophy,"" and if one studied philosophy at a Japanese university, one studied as a matter of course-and often exclusively-Western philosophers from Plato and Aristotle, through Descartes, Kant, and Hegel, to Husserl and Levinas. Of course, one might focus on a particular topic in order to clarify the relations between these different figures or to trace the history of a certain problematic; or one might go a step further and develop one's own philosophical path of thinking through one's study of these Western philosophers. But it remained the case that philosophy in modern Japan was an imported academic discipline of Western origin. The above state of affairs is historically explicable insofar as in premodern times there was, as Nakae Chomin famously quipped, ""no philosophy in Japan""-assuming, that is, that we strictly adhere to the Western concept of ""philosophy."" While this state of affairs had its historical conditions, the situation is beginning to change as we enter into a new era in which we can say-as Nishida Kitaro foresaw in the midst of the world-historical developments of his time-""the world is today becoming real."" In the wake of a shift away from the past identification of Western philosophy with philosophy as such, and in a movement toward opening up a discourse of ""world philosophy,"" new and important contributions to philosophy can be expected to come from ideas that originate in non-Western traditions of culture and thought. One reason for this is that the European philosophical tradition, the tradition that Japanese philosophers have long held up as a model, has entered an era of radical self-questioning. In particular, certain dominant ways of thinking in modern European philosophy, certain foundational ideas that were previously held to be certain and even self-evident, have fallen into question. The ontological notion of substance, the logical principle of identity, subject/object dualism in epistemology, the strict division between reason and sensibility, and underlying everything the idea of ""God"" or the distinctively modern idea of the absolute ""subject""-all of these at once dominant and fundamental ways of thinking, have fallen into question. We can look upon ""deconstruction"" as one palpable manifestation of this state of affairs. The turn away from the previous identification of European philosophy with philosophy as such, and the development of world philosophy, will no doubt advance a philosophical thinking that is no longer restricted to the specific ""love of wisdom"" and ""science of principles as the science of sciences"" that originated in the West. Contact between different traditions promises to help shed light on shared fundamental structures of human existence, and it will encourage new ways of bringing to awareness the understandings of the world and the self found in our various manners of being-in-the-world. What is being heralded as ""the end of philosophy"" concerns the system of knowledge that places metaphysics in the position of first philosophy. ""World philosophy"" calls for a transformation of philosophy itself along with a transformation of the world. For Western philosophy as well, an ""other beginning"" of thinking is called for; and the possibility of discovering indications for such an other beginning in the insights of traditions outside of Europe is now being realized.1 Now, in order for Japanese philosophy to be capable of making a meaningful contribution to world philosophy, Japanese philosophers need to go beyond their specialized research in European philosophy in order to discover, by way of a dialogical confrontation, what Nishida called a ""deeper ba in the newly shared world-horizon that opens up on this deeper basis. Two examples which met the above conditions, and which were articulated so as to be comprehensible to Westerners, are Suzuki Daisetsu's (Daisetz Suzuki) ""Eastern Way of Seeing"" and Izutsu Toshihiko's ""Eastern Philosophy."" It is the content of their works, and not just the fact that many of them were written in English, which made them significant initial formulations of what Japanese thinkers can contribute to world philosophy. While both concerned themselves with ""Eastern"" ideas, these ideas were reinterpreted within a worldhorizon and were creatively transformed to address the world. Beyond these contributions, on a properly philosophical level stands the thought of Nishida Kitaro, who took up the theme of the ""world."" And after Nishida, in the wake of changes in the spiritual climate of the world, the philosophy of Nishitani Keiji assumes special significance. Just as European philosophy as such should not be inflated into world philosophy, non-European traditions as they are cannot contribute directly to world philosophy. While European philosophy must be deconstructed and perhaps even pass through what Heidegger calls the end of philosophy to an other beginning from which it can undergo a transformative turn to world philosophy, the insights harbored in Eastern traditions need to be transformed into ""philosophical principles"" before they can contribute to world philosophy. Nishida's key ideas, such as ""pure experience,"" ""place,"" and ""contradictory self-identity,"" can be viewed as traditional insights transformed into philosophical principles. Nishitani took Mahayana Buddhism's key term ""emptiness"" and refashioned it into a fundamental philosophical category. The potential for Japanese philosophy to contribute to the development of world philosophy is based in at least the following two aspects of its historical foundations. First of all, the ""place"" of Japan-which is constituted in the understanding of self and world by means of the Japanese language-is not simply that of Japan alone, since the Japanese tradition harbors the influence of a number of traditions, including those of India, central Asia, China, and Korea. Shaped by these cross-fertilizations, the ""place"" of Japan developed as one great confluence of the rich sediments of these non-Western traditions, one that can undoubtedly serve as a significant reservoir of ideas for the formation of world philosophy. Secondly, this ""place"" of Japan now contains within it the experience, accumulated over the course of a century and a half, of a monumental encounter, collision, and exchange with Western culture and its products. Traversingthe two stages of the ""opening of the country"" (kaikoku) in the Meiji period and the country's defeat in World War II, and despite the fact that Japanese society on the whole-albeit with some exceptions-was characterized by a turning of its back on tradition (this too is a phenomenon of cross-cultural encounter), there were exceptional individuals who placed themselves in the gap between these radically different traditions and took up the challenge of rethinking the fundamental principles of the world from this vantage point. We inherit the fruits of the efforts of these great thinkers who subjected their very existence to their cross-cultural experiments. Examples include Natsume Soseki in literature, Nishida Kitaro in philosophy, and Suzuki Daisetsu in religion. Such intercultural experience in the ""place"" of Japan may well come to be seen as one paradigm for the interculturality and multiculturalism that is becoming such a prevalent concern in the world today. Japanese philosophy unfolds in the world and for the world, and Japanese philosophers are called on to show the world what and how they think. A positive contribution to world philosophy can be made by Japanese philosophers only if they engage in genuine self-criticism, that is to say, in self-criticism made real by taking into account criticism from the world. The present anthology, Japanese and Continental Philosophy: Conversations with the Kyoto School, which includes critical interpretations of and dialogues with the Kyoto School by European and North American scholars, is certainly a timely and significant venture. Confronted with Western philosophy, Nishida realized that the Eastern tradition was lacking in ""logic,"" and so he took as his life's task the formulation of such a logic. Japanese philosophy became in this situation a topos of thought which lets Japan be reflected in the world and lets the world be reflected in Japan. What is needed today is a world brought together by the fruits of mutual critique and mutual supplementation between different traditions. In order to discuss more specifically the kind of contributions that can be made by Japanese philosophy, let us look more closely at the philosophy of the Kyoto School. © 2011 by Indiana University Press.

The stipulation is still greatly important for many fields of human activity. Bogdan Suchodolski was not the first and the only thinker, who revealed the unquestionable significance of disseminating the history of science as scientific branch: For the first time the problem was noticed in 1900 during International Congress of Comparative History in Paris and in 1903 during International Congress of Historical Sciences in Rome, when the idea of universalizing the history of science was put forward, among others, by: Paul Tannery, Carre de Vaux, Gino Ioria and Karl Sudhoff. All the mentioned participants declared then the necessity of teaching the history of science both in the secondary schools and in the universities. In the article was also included a detailed description of conceptions formulated by Paul Tannery and Michel Lhéritier in the inter-war period that concerned popularizing the history of science, and differed much from each other. Unlike Paul Tannery, Michel Lhéritier advised against separating history of science from the whole of history. On the occasion of describing the inter-war period the author is paying a special attention to the role, which was played by International Conference of Teaching History in Hague in 1932. In that time a representative of International Committee on the History of Sciences and International Academy of the History of Sciences--Aldo Mieli--presented the idea of disseminating the history of science, which resulted in a resolution saying that the discussed branch should be taught in the primary and secondary schools, and in the universities as well. Further, the paper includes the description of the detailed conceptions that were put forward after World War II by the members of Committee on Teaching within International Academy of the History of Science and the participants of International Congress of the History of Science in 1965 and in 1968, and concerned the idea of introducing compulsory lectures on the history of science for prospective teachers and lecturers, and the ways of universalizing the discussed branch. The author is also presenting American conceptions of popularizing the history of science that were created by George Sarton, Derek J. de Solla Price and by Committee on University Education that was established in the 1970s. In the article one can find a specific reflection of Bogdan Suchodolski on popularizing the history of science through admitting its social role, making it the main element of educating 'the modern man' and teaching the branch in Poland. The author describes the above-mentioned stipulations in detail. At the same time, the last part of the paper reveals Polish thought in the field of disseminating the history of science in the inter-war period, so in times, when Bogdan Suchodolski was on the point of building his own idea. The author makes an attempt at showing to what extent Bogdan Suchodolski was inspired by one of the most famous Polish originators and precursors of a new branch 'science of science'--Florian Znaniecki. On this occasion the author draws definite conclusions concerning similarities and differences between the conception created by Bogdan Suchodolski, and the ideas that were put forward by his predecessor.",NA,Kwartalnik historii nauki i techniki : Kwartal'nyǐ zhurnal istorii nauki i tekhniki -,Article,2011,0,NA,Polish,NA
Bowman C.,56090346600,NA,Johann gottlieb fichte: Foundations of the entire science of knowledge,"Introduction Johann Gottlieb Fichte developed a system of philosophy known in German as the Wissenschaftslehre. The proper translation of this technical term has always been disputed, but Fichte scholars have usually settled on “Science of Knowledge”, “Doctrine of Science”, or “Theory of Scientific Knowledge”. None of these translations has ever been very informative, and they are even less helpful now that modern English tends to associate that which is scientific with the natural sciences and, to a lesser degree, the social sciences. Given the burden that the German term must bear, contemporary scholars routinely leave it untranslated in their discussions of Fichte's thought. Therefore, throughout this chapter Fichte's system will simply be called the Wissenschaftslehre. German philosophers in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries had a more expansive concept of science than we have today. Consequently, although the Wissenschaftslehre is not a science in our sense of the term, Fichte felt no discomfort in regarding his system as a scientific one. In so far as he considers the Wissenschaftslehre a science, Fichte argues not only that (i) it possesses a systematic form, but also that (ii) it possesses a systematic form in virtue of its being derived from a single first principle that is known with certainty. Moreover, he argues that (iii) the Wissenschaftslehre is the foundational discipline that grounds all theoretical and practical knowledge and demonstrates their fundamental unity; therefore, he sometimes refers to the Wissenschaftslehre as “the science of science”. Fichte's Foundations of the Entire Science of Knowledge attempts to demonstrate these three aspects of the Wissenschaftslehre. © Editorial matter and selection, 2005 John Shand.",NA,Central Works of Philosophy Volume 3: The Nineteenth Century,Book chapter,2010,0,NA,English,10.1017/UPO9781844653607.004

As government expenditures for promoting various branches of science increased dramatically on both sides of the East-West Cold War divide, some common issues regarding research management also emerged and with it an interest in closer academic interaction in the areas of history and policy of science. Through a close reading of many early issues of Minerva but also of its later competitor journal Science Studies (now called Social Studies of Science) the paper traces the initial optimism of an academically based Science Studies dialogue across the Cold War divide and the creation in 1971 of the International Commission for Science Policy Studies as a bridging forum, one that Minerva strangely chose to ignore. In this light, attention is drawn to aspects of the often forgotten history of Science Studies in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern European block. Reviewed also are several early discussions that are still relevant today: e. g., regarding differing concepts of Big Science, science and democracy, autonomy in higher education and what conditions are necessary to sustain academic freedom and scientific integrity (some of Edward Shils' primary concerns).

Watanabe T.,57199876791,"Toho University, Faculty of Science, Department of Environmental Science, Funabashi, 2748510, Miyama 2-2-1, Japan",Metascientific foundations for pluralism in psychology,"In this paper, I explore the metascientific basis for pluralism in psychology. In the first half, I outline the two levels of the metaparadigm: the epistemological and the methodological. The epistemological level includes the dichotomy between an internal, first-person point of view and an external, third-person one. The methodological level includes the dichotomy between explanation and understanding. The continuing debate regarding methodology, explanation versus understanding, has distinguished the human sciences from the natural sciences. Similarly, the continuing debate regarding the epistemological point of view has distinguished psychology from other sciences. I illustrate these points by placing various trends in psychology into the two-dimensional space formed by the two coordinate axes depicting the methodological and the epistemological dimensions. Each quadrant represents one definition of the object of psychology: quadrant 1 (internal, first-person - explanation) represents ""consciousness;"" quadrant 2 (internal, first-person - understanding) represents ""experiences;"" quadrant 3 (external, third-person - understanding) represents ""meaningful acts and expressions;"" and quadrant 4 (external, third-person - explanation) represents ""behaviors and higher processes of the brain."" All of the trends within the history of psychology can be placed within this two-dimensional space. In the second half of the paper, I introduce the third level of the metaparadigm: the metapsychological level. This level includes the three different, and incompatible conceptions of humans: the first-person, the second-person, and the third-person conceptions. A third-person conception of humans is most compatible with trends placed in quadrant 4. A second-person conceptualization is most congruent with quadrant 3, and so on. Thus, the unification of psychologies emerges as not only difficult but actually unreasonable, because the plurality of psychological paradigms originates from the epistemological, methodological, and metapsychological levels of the metaparadigm. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, the field can be traced to early quantitative studies in the early 20th century. In the 1930s, it evolved to the ""science of science."" The publication of J.D. Bernal's Social Function of Science in 1939 was a key transition point but the field lay dormant until after World War II, when D.J.D. Price's books Science Since Babylon and Little Science, Big Science were published in 1961 and 1963. His role as the ""Father of Scientometrics"" is clearly evident by using the HistCite software to visualize his impact as well as the subsequent impact of the journal Scientometrics on the growth of the field. Scientometrics owes its name to V.V. Nalimov, the author of Naukometriya, and to Tibor Braun who adapted the neologism for the journal. The primordial paper on citation indexing by Garfield which appeared in Science 1955 became a bridge between Bernal and Price. The timeline for the evolution of Scientometrics is demonstrated by a HistCite tabulation of the ranked citation index of the 100,000 references cited in the 3000 papers citing Price. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",Algorithmic; Bibliometrics; Derek J.D.

These criticisms constitute a ""second wave"" of challenges to this central argument in late-20th century philosophy of mind. Unlike the first wave, which challenged the premise that multiple realization is inconsistent with reduction or type identity, this second wave challenges the truth of the multiple realization premise itself. Since psychoneural reductionism was prominent among the explicit targets of the multiple realization argument, one might think that this second wave of challenges provides important aid and comfort to reductionists. In this paper, however, I provide reasons for thinking it does not. This is not to the detriment of psychoneural reductionism because, as I also argue here, and unrecognized by the current non-reductive orthodoxy in philosophy of mind, one key argument among the first wave of criticisms of the multiple realization argument has never been adequately rejoined. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Metascience; Molecular neuroscience; Multiple realization argument; Psychoneural reductionism,Synthese,Article,2010,22,NA,English,10.1007/s11229-010-9843-y

Roth W.-M.,57203214233,"Griffith University, Mt. Gravatt, QLD, Australia",Science of learning is learning of science: Why we need a dialectical approach to science education research,"Research on learning science in informal settings and the formal (sometimes experimental) study of learning in classrooms or psychological laboratories tend to be separate domains, even drawing on different theories and methods. These differences make it difficult to compare knowing and learning observed in one paradigm/context with those observed in the other. Even more interestingly, the scientists studying science learning rarely consider their own learning in relation to the phenomena they study. A dialectical, reflexive approach to learning, however, would theorize the movement of an educational science (its learning and development) as a special and general case-subject matter and method-of the phenomenon of learning (in/of) science. In the dialectical approach to the study of science learning, therefore, subject matter, method, and theory fall together. This allows for a perspective in which not only disparate fields of study-school science learning and learning in everyday life-are integrated but also where the progress in the science of science learning coincides with its topic. Following the articulation of a contradictory situation on comparing learning in different settings, I describe the dialectical approach. As a way of providing a concrete example, I then trace the historical movement of my own research group as it simultaneously and alternately studied science learning in formal and informal settings. I conclude by recommending cultural-historical, dialectical approaches to learning and interaction analysis as a context for fruitful interdisciplinary research on science learning within and across different settings. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Change; Cultural-historical activity theory; Dialectics; Learning; Research; Science education,Cultural Studies of Science Education,Article,2012,6,NA,English,10.1007/s11422-012-9390-6

Hales C.,34969259400,NA,Dual aspect science,"Our chronically impoverished explanatory capacity in respect of P-consciousness is highly suggestive of a problem with science itself, rather than its lack of acquisition of some particular knowledge. The hidden assumption built into science is that science itself is a completed human behaviour. Removal of this assumption is achieved through a simple revision to our science model which is constructed, outlined and named 'dual aspect science' (DAS). It is constructed with reference to existing science being 'single aspect science'. DAS is consistent with and predictive of the very explanatory poverty that generated it and is simultaneously a seamless upgrade; no existing law of nature is altered or lost. The framework is completely empirically self-consistent and is validated empirically. DAS eliminates the behavioural inconsistencies currently inhabiting a world in which single aspect science has been inherited rather than chosen and in which its presuppositions are implemented through habit rather than by scientific examination of options by the scientists actually carrying out science. The proposed DAS framework provides a working vantage point from which an explanation of P-consciousness becomes expected and meaningful. The framework requires that we rediscover what we scientists do and then discover something new about ourselves: that how we have been doing science is not the entire story.

Because knowledge spillovers, cumulative advantage, competition, and collaboration are distinctive features of the academic profession, both the employment relationship and the procedures for assigning recognition and allocating funding should be designed to account for these factors. We study the annual production n i(t) of a given scientist i by analyzing longitudinal career data for 200 leading scientists and 100 assistant professors from the physics community. Our empirical analysis of individual productivity dynamics shows that (i) there are increasing returns for the top individuals within the competitive cohort, and that (ii) the distribution of production growth is a leptokurtic ""tent-shaped"" distribution that is remarkably symmetric. Our methodology is general, and we speculate that similar features appear in other disciplines where academic publication is essential and collaboration is a key feature. We introduce a model of proportional growth which reproduces these two observations, and additionally accounts for the significantly right-skewed distributions of career longevity and achievement in science. Using this theoretical model, we show that short-term contracts can amplify the effects of competition and uncertainty making careers more vulnerable to early termination, not necessarily due to lack of individual talent and persistence, but because of random negative production shocks. We show that fluctuations in scientific production are quantitatively related to a scientist's collaboration radius and team efficiency.",Career trajectory; Computational sociology; Labor market; Science of science; Tenure,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Article,2012,132,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,English,10.1073/pnas.1121429109

It is predicated on the idea that major advances in knowledge will transpire when scholars, while pursuing their research interests, also consider addressing the core problems confronting society. For a workable engaged agenda in science and technology studies, one that informs scholarship as well as shapes practice and policy, the traditional terms of engagement must be renegotiated to be more open and mutual than has historically characterized the nature of inquiry in this field. At the same time, it is essential to protect individual privacy and preserve government confidentiality. Yet there is a scientific possibility for and benefit to introducing more collaborative and deliberative research approaches between scholar and subject in ways that will not violate these first-order ethics. To make the case, this article discusses the possibilities and perils of engaged science and technology scholarship by drawing on our own recent experiences to conduct and apply STS research while embedded in the National Science Foundation. Brief accounts of these experiences reveal the opportunities as well as the challenges of engaged scholarship. They also provide lessons for those fellow travelers who might follow the authors to this or other like host organizations with ambitions of increasing fundamental knowledge about and applying research to the policies, programs, and decisions of the scientific enterprise. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Embedded research; Science of science; Social engagement,Science and Engineering Ethics,Article,2011,28,NA,English,10.1007/s11948-011-9307-x

This article offers a brief overview of Bourdieu's framework, placing it in the context of dominant trends in Science and Technology Studies. Bourdieu provides an excellent justification for the project of the sociology of science, and some starting points for analysis. However, his framework suffers from his commitment to a vague evolutionary epistemology, and from his correlative and surprising neglect of science's habituses, with their particular practices, boundaries, and political economies. To be productive, Bourdieu's sociology of science would have to abandon its narrow rationalism and embrace the material complexity of the sciences. © The Author(s) 2011.",Bourdieu; evolutionary epistemology; political economies of knowledge; Science and Technology Studies; sociology of science,Cultural Sociology,Article,2011,19,NA,English,10.1177/1749975510389728

At the same time, he also proposed to have effectively countered any relativistic views of science. In this article, I contend that Bourdieu’s project to develop an argument against cognitive relativism nevertheless fell short of its goal, owing to his confusion between consensus and absolute truth. It is absolute truth that is the opposite of relativism, not consensus. In addition, Bourdieu’s project fails in its attempt to refute relativism on empirical grounds. An empirical argument has only limited value as an argument against cognitive relativism. Moreover, Bourdieu’s overly sharp distinction between natural-scientific and social scientific research, if consistently followed, carries the risk of throwing sociology of science back into a Mannheimian sociology-of-knowledge mould. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",Bourdieu; Cognitive relativism; Consensus; Knowledge; Relativism; Sociology; Sociology of science; Truth,Distinktion,Article,2012,1,NA,English,10.1080/1600910X.2012.658825

However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution, geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence of a giant component of scientific collaboration.

Three projects for theoretical psychology are sketched: theory construction (Kukla), naturalism (the Churchlands) and its variant metascience, and social constructionism (Gergen). It is argued that each is in itself valuable, but also that each is lacking in important respects. Metascience has no resources for a critical distance; social constructionism seems often stuck in de(con)structive mode; and theory construction seems captive to an outdated divide between data and theory. The thesis is that we may conceive of theoretical psychology as a continuum from theory construction to deconstruction, with different degrees of reflection, interpretation, integration, and criticism of research programs in psychology. Furthermore, reflection will often start from existing empirical research (contra Kukla, and, in a different way, contra Gergen), but nevertheless have the resources to criticize it (contra ultra-naturalistic metascience).

Instead we should pursue an unbiased examination of the methods used throughout relevant areas of neuroscience. The chapter focuses on reductionist work in the neurobiological discipline of molecular and cellular cognition. It is argued that reduction is a matter of causal intervention into low level mechanisms, and tracking of the effects of these interventions through levels. When interventions provide evidence that activity in the proposed reductive mechanism co-varies reliably with activity in the target property, such that appealing to higher-level mechanisms will not add any extra explanatory power, reduction can succeed.

First, analyses of 8,631 title words published in these journals between 1979 and 2008 (808 articles) show an increasing interest in researching sex, sex differences, faces, and attractiveness. For example, during the Ethology and Sociobiology era (1979-1996), the most frequent title words were ""evolutionary,"" ""human,"" ""behavior,"" ""reproductive,"" ""evolution,"" ""selection,"" and ""altruism,"" whereas during the Evolution and Human Behavior era (1997-2008), they were ""sex,"" ""attractiveness,"" ""differences,"" ""sexual,"" ""human,"" ""male,"" and ""facial."" Second, we reveal the 20 most-cited articles in these journals, which show the importance of research teams.

Deer C.,6507497869,"Balliol College, Oxford, United Kingdom",Reflexivity,"Introduction From Sociologie de l'Algérie (Bourdieu 1958) to Pascalian Meditations (Bourdieu 2000a) and Science of Science and Reflexivity (Bourdieu 2004b) the notion of reflexivity is both at the origin and the heart of Pierre Bourdieu's work. As a methodological concept, reflexivity occupies a central role in the evolution of his work, not to say a defining one if it is to be understood within the intellectual field: Bourdieu has been insistently pointing at the possibility of a unified political economy of practice, and especially of symbolic power that fuses structural and phenomenologically-inspired approaches into a coherent, epistemologically grounded, mode of social enquiry of universal applicability … but one that is highly distinctive in that it explicitly encompasses the activity of the social analyst who sets out to offer accounts of the practice of others. (Wacquant, in Bourdieu & Wacquant 1989d: 26–7) A concept is defined according to how it is understood and extended. As such, reflexivity in Bourdieu's intertwined empirical and theoretical work is the moving representation of an object through the constant (re)formulation-expression of its use and its meaning. This is accompanied by parallel illustrations of its practically-grounded scientific and epistemological relevance and significance (Bourdieu 1977b; 1988a; 1990c; 1994e; 1998c). Certain concepts gain in applicability through the extension of the way they may be understood and used – often at the cost of coherence. However, reflexivity, as defined in Bourdieu's work, has followed a different path as he has sought to explain and refine its meaning and its multiple applicability, not least in relation to its evolving environment. © Editorial matter and selection, 2008 Michael Grenfell.",NA,Pierre Bourdieu: Key Concepts,Book chapter,2010,18,NA,English,10.1017/UPO9781844654031.017

Methodologically applied with the intention to produce results about the social configuration that the researcher himself/herself is part of, such an empirical task can be interpreted in terms of the principles of reflexivity in social science as they are advocated by the work of Pierre Bourdieu: empirical work therefore follows the epistemological interest to reveal the conditions that covertly and unconsciously structure the work and the interest itself, thus enabling the researcher to gain knowledge about the influences and effects constituting the process of research. In this essay we argue that the social network analysis by STEINBRINK et al. (2010 and in this issue) implies similarities to those principles of science of scientific work and therefore to the work of Pierre Bourdieu on the scientific field with its focus on structuring power relations and the role and positionality of the (researching) subject within this specific social field. By following this we show that the analysis of quality and strength of social relations also implies an analysis of the power structures in the given sample. Moreover, a correlation of the socio-analytical theories of Pierre Bourdieu with the empirical tools of the social network analysis has to include further aspects (e.g. the limits of the field or the pathways of the subjects) to understand the social embeddedness of the researched network in the social space. We thus focus with our ""re-reading"" of the discussed study on the following two major aspects: (a) the project's proximity to Bourdieus principles of reflexivity in and about social science and (b) the potential of an analysis of the intrinsic power relations, which is in our view brought forth by the discussed study. Building on those aspects we argue for an invitation to the manifold practice of ""science of science and reflexivity"" (BOURDIEU 2004b) within Human Geography.",NA,Berichte zur Deutschen Landeskunde,Review,2012,1,NA,German,NA

Consistent with recent research on the science of science and innovation policy, we employ a difference-in-differences approach using bibliometric data with the aim of analyzing the causal impact of the policy on cumulative research. Our estimates suggest that in the aftermath of the 2001 policy, U.S. production of hESC research lagged 35 to 40 percent behind anticipated levels. However, this relative decline was largely concentrated in the years 2001 to 2003 and ameliorated over time. The rebound in U.S. hESC research after 2003 was driven by contributions by researchers at elite U.S. institutions and U.S. researchers who collaborated with international partners.

As a methodological concept, reflexivity occupies a central role in the evolution of his work, not to say a defining one if it is to be understood within the intellectual field: Bourdieu has been insistently pointing at the possibility of a unified political economy of practice, and especially of symbolic power that fuses structural and phenomenologically-inspired approaches into a coherent, epistemologically grounded, mode of social enquiry of universal applicability… but one that is highly distinctive in that it explicitly encompasses the activity of the social analyst who sets out to offer accounts of the practice of others. A concept is defined according to how it is understood and extended. As such, reflexivity in Bourdieu's intertwined empirical and theoretical work is the moving representation of an object through the constant (re)formulation/expression of its use and its meaning. This is accompanied by parallel illustrations of its practically-grounded scientific and epistemological relevance and significance (Bourdieu 1977b; 1990c; 1988a; 1994d; 1998c). Certain concepts gain in applicability through the extension of the way they may be understood and used - often at the cost of coherence. However, reflexivity, as defined in Bourdieu's work, has followed a different path as he has sought to explain and refine its meaning and its multiple applicability, not least in relation to its evolving environment. © Editorial matter and selection 2008, 2012 Michael Grenfell.",NA,"Pierre Bourdieu: Key Concepts, Second Edition",Book chapter,2012,26,NA,English,NA

One reason for taking a dual position relates to the fact that members of gaming and simulation associations represent two distinct branches of science: the design and analytical sciences.

The paper has also been seen to support parts of the received view of Fleck, notably that he manufactured an anti-typhus vaccine while imprisoned in Buchenwald. However, a different narrative emerges when comparing Fleck's paper with other accounts, also published in 1946 and written by other prisoners alluded to by Fleck in his paper. The situation is further complicated by four papers, published in prestigious scientific journals between 1942 and 1945, by the German medical leader of the typhus studies accounted for by Fleck. In addition, a thus-far neglected paper by Fleck, published in 1946 and summarizing his observations on typhus, discloses his role in the Buchenwald studies. Despite the obvious difficulties with tracing the history behind these works, notably the one on Nazi science, the contention is that what was attempted in Buchenwald in the name of science amounted to pseudoscience. This conclusion is amply supported not only by the accounts given by Fleck's fellow prisoners, but also by his own post-war paper on typhus. Based on the above findings, it is suggested that the mythology about Fleck, established in the 1980s, has been accomplished by a selective reading of his papers and also that the role played by Fleck was more complex than has so far been contemplated. © SSS and SAGE Publications.",Buchenwald studies; Ding-Schuler; Ludwik Fleck; Nazi science; Typhus vaccine,Social Studies of Science,Article,2008,12,NA,English,10.1177/0306312707082953

Philosophers can and should function as social critics, as conceptual analysts, as “critical spectators” of science, as ethicists, and as educators. An example of the philosopher's role as social critic may be found in the analysis of the methods and presuppositions of public policy making. The philosopher as conceptual analyst can add clarity to environmental debates through analyses of such terms as “ecosystem”, “integrity”, “responsibiity” and “nature”. “Meta-Science” is exemplified in an examination of the role of values in scientific investigation and in the scientist's contributions to public policy-making. The philosopher as environmental ethicist should seek a balanced and integrated view of both the naturalness of the human condition, and of the unique human quality of moral agency.

Reduction of functional psychology to (cognitive) neuroscience is no longer ruthless enough; we should now look rather to cellular or molecular neuroscience at the lowest possible level for explanations of memory, consciousness and attention. Bickle presents a fascinating set of experimental cases of such molecule-to-mind explanations. This book qualifies as a showcase of naturalism in the philosophy of mind. Naturally, many of the traditional conceptual approaches in the philosophy of mind are given short shrift, but - in Bickle's metascientific scheme - the role of philosophy of science also seems reduced to explicating laboratory findings. The present reviewers think that this reductionism suffers from overstretching; in particular, the idea of 'explanation in a single bound' from molecule to mind is a bit too ruthless.

Visualizing the history of science with HistCite software,"While ISSI was founded in 1993, scientometrics and bibliometrics are now at least half a century old. Indeed, the field can be traced to early quantitative studies in the early 20th Century. In the thirties, it evolved to the ""science of science."" The publication of J. D. Bernal's Social Function of Science in 1939 was a key transition point but the field lay dormant until after World War II, when DJD Price's books Science Since Babylon in and Little Science, Big Science in were published in1961 and 1963. His role as the ""father of scientometrics"" is clearly evident by using the HistCite software to visualize his impact as well as the subsequent impact of the journal Scientometrics on the growth of the field. Scientometrics owes its name to V. V. Nalimov, the author of Naukometriya, and to Tibor Braun who adapted the neologism for the journal. The primordial paper on citation indexing by Garfield which appeared in Science 1955 became a bridge between Bernal and Price. The timeline for the evolution of scientometrics is demonstrated by a HistCite tabulation of the ranked citation index of all the 100,000 references cited in the 3,000 papers citing Price.",Algorithm; Bibliometrics; Derek J.D.

Examples from genetics and linguistics suggest, first, that not every mind-brain link or gene-phenotype link qualifies as a reduction or as a complete explanation, and, second, that the higher (psychological) level of analysis is not likely to disappear as neuroscience progresses. The most plausible picture of the evolving sciences of the mind-brain seems a patchwork of multiple connections and partial explanations, linking anatomy, mechanisms and functions across different domains, levels, and grain sizes. Bickle's claim that only the molecular level provides genuine explanations, and higher level concepts are just heuristics that will soon be redundant, is thus rejected. In addition, it is argued that Bickle's recasting of philosophy of science as metascience explicating empirical practices, ignores an essential role for philosophy in reflecting upon criteria for reduction and explanation.

Against this contention, it argues that works such as Distinction should be viewed as critiques of an absolutist universalism rather than of universalism as such. Moreover, Bourdieu's logic of practice, it is claimed, caters not only for a degree of autonomy at the level of the individual, but also identifies two key intellectual fields as pivotal cultural accumulators of autonomous or critical thought: the artistic field and the scientific field. In this context, it is particularly important that one of his very late works, Science of Science and Reflexivity, gives such a vital role to the free ‘corporation’ of scientists as judges of scientific reputations. His concept of artistic autonomy is further explored by illustrations from casestudies in historical sociology, by writers who have been decisively influenced by his sociology of literature. The article ends with an application of his ideas to contemporary newspaper obituaries of cultural producers. This illuminates in particular an underlying issue in his sociology: current dangers to artistic autonomy. © 2006, Sage Publications.

Each of the six chapters of the book provides a specific perspective on the general subject, Human Activity and on the general theory, Activity Theory. Outline The first chapter introduces the historical background of Activity Theory including the evolution of the theory from Hegel to Marx and the two Russian psychologists Vygotsky and Leont'ev. Ch. 2 covers the basic problems of ontology and evolution; the ontology assumes an original cosmological object field, from which a biological field emerged, and from the latter an anthropological object field emerged. Ch. 3 analyses the relation between pre-human activity, belonging to the biological object field, and humnn activity, belonging to the anthropological field, the characteristics of which are discussed. In Ch. 4, epistemology is discussed from the perspective of human activity. Ch. 5 attempts to clarify the problem of meaning, and in this connection the leading theories in semiotics and language theory are discussed. Finally, Ch.6 is dedicated to the study of science that is, the discipline of Metascience.

Gordon M.D.,57213234311,"Primary Communications Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH, United Kingdom",Methodological pluralism in a multidimensional world,"Reflecting on Moravcsik's paper and his assertion that a damaging dominant one-dimensionalism prevails within the science of science, one can draw the following conclusions. Firstly, the one-dimensionalism described by Moravcsik is a misrepresentation of a great deal of useful and valid ""scientometric"" research. This work is not so methodologically or theoretically naive as Moravcsik seeks to suggest, nor is it so uniform. Secondly, Moravcsik's assertion that there is little multidimensional work being carried out overlooks the considerable body of such research being published in the sociology of science. Thirdly, the sociology of science is but one sub-field of the science of science, and each such sub-field is characterized by its own sets of objectives and resource constraints. The nature of these objectives and constraints determines the relative suitability of particular methodologies and the optimal mix of methodologies. This in turn influences the relative frequency of adoption of those approaches which can be described as either ""one-"" or multidimensional. The result is that contrary to Moravcsik's assertions, a methodological pluralism already exists; a methodological pluralism which should be recognised as a natural consequence of the diversity of research objectives and constraints which characterize the science of science, as well as the wide range of disciplinary backgrounds of those who work within it. As the science of science has itself shown, discussion of cognitive content should not be totally divorced from consideration of social context. © 1984 Akadémiai Kiadó.",NA,Scientometrics,Article,1984,0,NA,English,10.1007/BF02021281

The contributions of the psychophysiological study of the body and mind, such as the use of the electroencephalogram during Zen meditation, are described. Key names in this field are K. Sato and Akishige, who organized the project team for the study of Zen and endeavored to give these studies international recognition through the publication of books and the journal, Psychologia. Not only the practice of Zen meditation, but also the day-to-day practices of monastic life, are given equal priority in the attempt to understand our true self and real nature. The year 1978 marks the turning point in the study of Zen and psychology because Akishige introduced the idea of Zen psychology; which is the amalgamation of Zen thought with the study of psychological problems, particularly related to the control of emotions. The metascience of the study of Zen is cited by first-, second-and third-person psychology (Watanabe, 1994).

But, what did he mean by metapattern (which he used only once)? Can there be a meta-science, in which metapatterns are its objects or principles? The authors explore these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The authors review examples of Bateson's ""great pattern"" of ""combination,"" which the authors call the binary. Bateson showed that binary is the minimal solution to the problem of gaining new characteristics by combining parts into a larger whole. Thus, binary is clearly a metapattern, a discipline-transcending structural and functional principle. The authors select parts of Bateson's writings to highlight his search for other great patterns, some of which correspond with those developed by T. Volk. Findings - The authors suggest that the basis for a science of metapatterns is the following: functional patterns that confer advantages on the systems that possess those patterns can converge, in a meta-realm that includes all of what Bateson termed stochastic sequences, namely, in biological, cultural, and cognitive realms. The convergences are common solutions to the same functional problems that span a wide variety of systems. Other general principles in the organization of systems, such as borders, arrows, cycles, centers, and networks, constitute members of a system of metapatterns, the objects in a Batesonian metascience. The authors show that the metapatterns have implications for research in the humanities and social sciences, as well as for dynamic learning along the lines of Bateson's broadly-extended concept of epistemology. Originality/value - As nearly universal functional patterns, metapatterns could serve to create a scale-bridging form of descriptive scholarship and thus contribute to the quest for a unified body of knowledge, which E.O. Wilson termed Consilience. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Cybernetics; Sciences; Systems theory,Kybernetes,Article,2007,7,NA,English,10.1108/03684920710777847

Although the analytic positivists can indeed help us to answer these questions, their world‐view has nevertheless functioned as a constraint upon the development of political theory by ignoring (more or less) the methods of the understanding traditions. Because, if you fail to understand the complex of problems in a given text‐system, you are also in danger of analysing and criticizing nothing but your own misunderstandings ‐ of kidding no‐one but yourself. In the case of David Easton's concept of political persistence, such analytic misunderstandings have helped to produce a one‐dimensional picture of the systems model, which, however, can be dissolved by uniting world‐view, metascience, and science of respectively the analysts and the interpreters within the framework of the critical traditions.

It can abandon this inferiority if it relocates itself in terms of a politics of knowledge. Science studies should stop viewing itself as a quilt patch of subjects and reading itself as a creative mediation between knowledge and power. This is illustrated in terms of the emergence of Science Studies in India. Official India emphasized science policy as an extension of the Nation-State. Science studies arose as a response to science policy questioning the social contract between Science and State in India. Science studies emerged as a part of civil society after the Emergency of 1975 and among social movements rather than as a professionalized academic subject. In attempting to create an identity, science studies moved across four axis of possibility: the science of science, interdisciplinary science, transscience and alternative science. The second part of the paper links science studies to the democratic imagination. It argues that the citizen must be seen as a scientist, a person of knowledge not merely as a consumer and voter. The citizen thus becomes a trustee of local, defeated and marginal forms of knowledge. Its real role is in enhancing the democratic imagination, providing methodologies of conflict resolution and plural frameworks of knowledge for cognitive justice, thus emerging as a site for dissenting imaginations against the emerging global regime. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Two tests were administered at the end of the learning unit: (a) a video-taped group test for assessing pupils’ mastery of formal reasoning skills; (b) a test designed to assess pupils’ achievements in biology at three cognitive levels: knowledge, application, and interpretation. Results show significant, positive correlations (r = from 0.57 to 0.77) between pupils’ cognitive stages and their biology achievements. Analysis of pupils’ answers disclosed that only pupils at the concrete cognitive stage made errors. The findings of this study support the Piagetian notion that learning may be subordinated to cognitive development. Findings also show that mastery of formal cognitive skills, although necessary, is not sufficient for high achievement in learning biology. pupils’ learning outcomes in each content area and to consider affective as well as cognitive factors. To understand the issue better, it was decided to assess the specific science course objectives which were achieved by pupils at different cognitive stages. This approach, used by Lawson and Renner (1975), Karplus et al. (1977), and Shayer (1978), contributed many insights to pupils’ difficulties in learning science.

Some disciplines, such as medicine, mathematics, and astronomy, have numerous noteworthy compendia and even specialized journals where papers on the history of these sciences can be published. The situation in geophysics, meteorology, and other subdivisions of the geosciences is far less favorable. This neglect is an outcome of a dogma of autonomy that is essentially oriented toward progress in understanding, without much reference to historical developments. But even the geoscientists cannot ignore that the phenomenon ‘science’ must be viewed in the context of sociological processes. In the initial stages, sociologists and some philosophers, in the context of the general theory of perception, began research into the development of scientific thought, but the geoscientists and other natural scientists contributed very little. It has since become clear that research on these topics requires historical assessment and more insight. The development of the ‘science of science’ is directed toward understanding and explanation of the complex human involvement in science, not only in the sense of theorizing about the scientific processes but also in sociological, political, and historical context [Kuhn, 1973; Burrichter, 1979; Sandkühler and Plath, 1979.] ©1981.

Change has resulted from research in three areas: pathophysiology, weaning-predictor testing, and weaning techniques. Physiology research illuminated the mechanisms of weaning failure. It also uncovered markers of weaning success. Through more reliable prediction, patients whose weaning would have been tedious in the 1970s are now weaned more rapidly. The weaning story offers several lessons in metascience: importance of creativity, the asking of heretical questions, serendipity, mental-set psychology, cross-fertilization, and the hazards of precocity. Weaning research also illustrates how Kuhnian normal (metoo) science dominates any field. Making the next quantum leap in weaning will depend on spending less time on normal science and more on the raising (and testing) of maverick ideas. © 2006 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Control of breathing; Cross-fertilization; Diagnostic testing; Mechanical ventilation; Metascience; Monitoring; Pathophysiology; Randomized clinical trials; Respiratory muscles; Serendipity; Weaning,Applied Physiology in Intensive Care Medicine,Book chapter,2006,0,NA,English,10.1007/3-540-37363-2_51

It then introduces some meta-scientific perspectives and a discussion of a metaphor that has considerable explanatory power. Two main schools of metascience are presented and contrasted. The difference between treating invariances in natural sciences and in social and cultural sciences is discussed. The double helix is introduced as a generic metaphor to highlight important distinctions. Highlighting new distinctions in this way can help to avoid simply assimilating them into already familiar distinctions. The paper also discusses how some metascientific perspectives and the transdisciplinary generalized concept of informing science can be seen as related. Finally, the paper argues that computerized models never keep up with continuously changing situations. However, people always have to handle the full variety of situations, including those not foreseen during requirements engineering.

The unit was designed to help students learn Western science by building bridges between their traditional practices and beliefs on selected health-related matters and conventional science concepts. Students' responses to a summative test were analysed qualitatively by a process of coding and categorising. The results indicated, firstly, that students did not necessarily show that they had learned conventional science when personalised tasks were associated with contextualised stimuli. Secondly, students' responses provided evidence of parallel collateral learning. These findings were deliberately explored during a second research cycle. The initial findings were corroborated.

The dichotomy of what ought to be and what exists is the linchpin of ethical research. The ethics of science appraises newly acquired knowledge and practical steps as being desirable or undesirable, morally acceptable or justified. It operates within the range of modalities that belong to the sphere of moral judgments. This determines one of the two dimensions of the two-dimensional space and provides an impetus for the development of the ethics of science. Today, the research impetus comes to the fore in works of another genre. This enables to regard the sphere of the ethics of science as the two-dimensional space formed by the axes of moral and cognitive judgments. Society today faces a crisis in science/society relations; therefore, there is the need for the ethics of science. It provides special knowledge about scientific activity and this type of knowledge distinguishes it from all other fields of the science of science. © 1989, Elsevier Inc.

In other words, pharmaceutical people in Japan should have much more pharmaceutical philosophy. The late Professor Komei Miyaki, founder Editor-in-Chief of FARUMASHIA, the monthly membership magazine of Pharmaceutical Society of Japan, under whom I worked as one of editorial board members, taught me that scientists should have their own philosophy of their sciences. Such a pharmaceutical philosophy as mentioned above should be established on the basis of complete separation of medical profession between doctors and pharmacists, which form the most important and necessary issue in safety assurance for patients with the complete zero defect (ZD action), as there is a long history for that in Europe since the separation was completed by King Friedrich II in 1240. Therefore, we have to learn the social status of European/American pharmacist practitioners who are the great No. 1 among all the professions. European pharmacists guarantee the safety of every chemical used for human body and pets, such as medicines, cosmetics, foods, tooth stuffs and so on. Regarding the pharmaceutical sciences in Japan also there seems to be a lack of pharmaceutical philosophy, as pharmaceutical scientists have no identity in research object that may be similar to basic scientists who are non-pharmacy graduates. Japanese sciences generally have developed along the lines of the Western model, reaching the current high level. We now not only should receive profits from the outside but also should embark on a mission to support pharmaceutical sciences throughout the world, especially Asian courtiers. At the present, we do not seem to be fulfilling our mission to do that, even though general activity includes significant international exchange. We have to make much more effort for international contribution/participation. For that, the most important and necessary issue is to make change in fundamental sense in Japanese pharmaceutical community, though an internationalization of technological issues is usually taken into consideration. In this connection, regarding the new drug development, we must have a change in the sense to establish pharmaceutical philosophy and jump up in conception from the existing one. Based on the above mentioned pharmaceutical philosophy, seven star pharmacists should be educated as described in 2000 FIP Statement of Policy: Good Pharmacy Education Practice, who could be a (1) care giver; (2) decision maker; (3) communicator; (4)leader; (5) manager; (6) life-long learner; (7)teacher. © 2003 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Creation of new pharmaceutical science; Pharmaceutical philosophy; Professional separation between medical doctors and pharmacists; Research on research; Science of science; Seven star pharmacists,Yakugaku Zasshi,Review,2003,5,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Japanese,10.1248/yakushi.123.143

Hamlin C.,7006982171,"Department of History, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556, United States",Reflexivity in Technology Studies: Toward a Technology of Technology (and Science)?,"In recent years scholars have begun to apply perspectives of the sociology of scientific knowledge to technology. At the same time, there has been much concern about how to deal, methodologically, with the issue of reflexivity in sociological (and historical) studies of science. This paper considers implications of the reflexivity issue for sociological and historical accounts of technology. Drawing on characterizations of technology (mainly by its historians), the paper develops several senses in which technology is conceived to differ significantly from science. Accordingly, assumptions and approaches, contexts and expectations associated with the sociology of scientific knowledge may be inappropriate to the study of technology. These differences can be used to gain insights into the reflexivity question. If, as we have done in science, we look to the activity we study for guidance about how to study it, we may find technology to warrant a different conception of the location and purposes of its analysts than does science - a conception of the studier not as an isolated knower, but as a socially and politically involved co-creator. In line with recent suggestions of Sal Restivo and Bruno Latour, our activity as STS scholars might then better be characterized as a technology of technology (or science), rather than as a science of science (or technology). © 1992, SAGE Publications.

Military and industrial scientists tend to accept H, while medical and environmental scientists tend to reject it. Proponents of the strong programme claim this debate shows that uncertain science can be clarified only by greater attention to the social values influencing it. While they are in part correct, this paper argues that methodological analyses (not merely attention to social values) also can help clarify uncertain science. The paper analyzes five measurement uncertainties, as well as seven methodological value judgments, relevant to H. Using criteria of internal and external consistency, as well as predictive power, it argues that metascience also helps resolve this debate. And if so, then value-laden, policy-relevant science may need, not only more attention to social values in order to resolve and to clarify disputes, but also more conceptual and methodological analyses of science. (This paper suggests what such methodological analyses might be like and uses the case of low-dose risks from radiation to illustrate its points, while a companion paper (""Chemical Hormesis, Conceptual Clarification, and the Warrant for Policy-Driven Science"") in this same issue of POS suggests what such conceptual analyses might be like and uses the case of low-dose risks from chemicals to illustrate its points.)

These concepts are linked to three aspects of philosophy of science: logic of science, sociology of science, and ethics of science. The discussion focusses on the problematic relation between logic of science (philosophy of science in its central meaning) and sociology of science (or science of science). Further topics: (1) The distinction between the 'research form' and the 'theory form' of science. While analyses in the philosophy of science are first of all oriented towards the 'theory form' of science (under the concepts of the theory structure, theory dynamics, and theory explication), it is the 'research form' of science which will be of growing importance now. (2) Different approaches in the philosophy of science lead to different models of (scientific) rationality (the models of fallibilism, historism, and structuralism).

The weaning story offers several lessons in metascience: importance of creativity, the asking of heretical questions, serendipity, mental-set psychology, cross-fertilization, and the hazards of precocity.

Efforts to attain ever greater specificity and standardization, guided by the idea of uniform methodology, are leading researchers steadily further away from the unique case. The underlying assumptions in current psychotherapy research are defined and the necessity of returning to case studies is indicated. Research methods need to be relevant and to make use of essential aspects of what is being researched (care of the research object). Psychotherapy research cannot avoid interpretations of meaning, and clinical methods should have a steering role. Case‐study methods lead to specific problems of control and generalization. The scientific research strategy used in case studies is described and compared with the hermeneutic circle. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

The boisterous development of landscape ecology as interdisciplinary science, which originated at the penetration of the geographic and ecological research approaches in order to solve the accumulating ecological and environmental problems, requires constitution of its meta-scientific superstructure in form of meta-landscape ecology. The importance of meta-landscape ecology lies above all in specification of external and internal position of landscape ecology within the framework of other sciences. This is connected with the need of deeper analysis of identity of landscape ecology. Also elaboration of landscape-ecological metatheory and methodology will be required as both represent the skeleton of meta-landscape ecology. The interdisciplinary function of landscape ecology must be enforced by elaboration of the question of landscape-ecological metalanguage to facilitate the scientific multi-disciplinary communication.

Contrariwise, the ignored so far quaint nature of knowledge, escaping even from the elementary empirical treating - discernment and observation - is revealed and demonstrated. This peculiar nature requires, accordingly, a specific meta-cognitive dealing for positing it as 'empirical object', unfortunately missed still by the Strong Programme.

The difference between the Renyi and Boltzmann-Shannon entropies (a modified Lyapunov functional ΛR) for the same power-law distribution is negative and as a function of β has a well-defined minimum at β* which remains within the narrow range from 1.5 to 3 when varying other characteristic parameters of any concrete systems.

Increasing public concern about the social role of science is forcing science students to think about what they are actually learning to do. What sort of knowledge will they be producing, and how will it be used? Science education now requires serious consideration of these philosophical and ethical questions. But the many different forms of knowledge produced by modern science cannot be covered by any single philosophical principle. Sociology and cognitive psychology are also needed to understand what the sciences have in common and the significance of what they generate. Again, traditional modes of ethical analysis cannot deal adequately with the values, norms and interests activated by present-day technoscience without reference to its sociological, political and economic dimensions. What science education now requires is 'metascience', a discipline that extends beyond conventional philosophy and ethics to include the social and humanistic aspects of the scientific enterprise. For example, students need to learn about the practices, institutions, career choices, and societal responsibilities of research scientists, and to rehearse in advance some of the moral dilemmas that they are likely to meet.

Inhaber H.,56632610800,"Science Policy Branch, Environment Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1A OH3, Canada",Changes in centralization of science,"An important aspect of the 'science of science' is its geography. One way of studying this aspect is to evaluate the degree of dispersion or centralization of scientists. The calculation has been performed for the 16 countries with the greatest number of scientists. Czechoslovakia and Sweden have the highest concentration in a few cities, while the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany have the lowest concentration. In general, the degree of concentration varies inversely with the total number of scientists in a country, although there are exceptions. Part of the 'concentration effect' is due to a large number of scientists in one city, usually the capital. When the effect of the leading city is removed, the ranking of the countries changes sharply. Switzerland and Australia have the highest concentrations, and the United States and the United Kingdom have the lowest. Only a weak relationship is then shown between the total number of scientists and the degree of concentration. To remove the effect of population concentration, the cumulative proportion of scientists was divided by the cumulative proportion of population for the leading cities. This produced considerable change in the rankings by nation. The USSR and India have the highest proportions. Countries with low proportions included the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. Almost all countries had a greater degree of dispersion in 1972 as compared with 1967. The greatest changes towards dispersion were seen in India and the USSR. © 1977.",NA,Research Policy,Article,1977,4,NA,English,10.1016/0048-7333(77)90024-5

However, “ideology” can be redefined at the level of a meta‐science that reduces, though it cannot altogether eliminate, the partisan function of language about politics. Ideological thinking can then be shown to involve a logical error that is the counterpart of the genetic fallacy.

The arrangement of the bibliography is alphabetical by the first author, for each author a chronological order is used. Anonymous and edited works are filed under title.

Elementary techniques, such as following up the references in relevant documents, have been applied whenever possible and most documents have been scrutinized by actual reading. Papers on mobility in physics are rather widely dispersed in the literature, ranging from sociological analyses to science policy considerations. Since the information in numerous publications have important professional implications, the bibliography appears at the eve of the European Physical Society seminar on ""Career outlook for physicists in Europe"" in Erice, 25-27 June 1981.

Fischer C.T.,7402486572,"Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",Intelligence contra IQ: A human science critique and alternative to the natural science approach to man,"With the transformation of intelligence into IQ as a concrete reference point, this article indicates the general social impact of psychology practicedas a natural science. A metascience examiniation of the latter’s approach to man reveals the interrelations of its assumptions, methods, and content, while thus suggesting the need for a specifically human science. This alternative’s assumptions, methods, and content are specified as being rooted in a rigorous existential-phenom-enological philosophy. The human science approach is proffered as one comprehensive enough to account for man’s possibilities as well as his necessary restrictions. A human science understanding of intelligence is presented, along with remarks about its practical implementation. © 1973 by S.

Counelis J.S.,6507551606,"School of Education, University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94117, United States",Cybernetics and general systems—A unitary science?: (Information and the unity of general systems theory and cybernetics),"Man has the propensity to seek, design, impose and maintain unities. These unities are at the interstice where man and his environment intersect. These unities are information. Hence, information (I) is defined as the goal-directed (V−1) communicational intersect between a person (P) and his environment (E). That is: I =fV−1(P ∩ E). There are four generic information systems: (1) Symbolic Records; (2) Languages; (3) Disciplines; (4) Societal Knowledges. In the context of generic information systems, both general systems theory and cybernetic function as meta-science (V−1). In effect these can produce equifinally identical science, thus inferring that general systems theory and cybernetics are unitary. © 1979, MCB UP Limited.

Stevens S.S.,57218358149,NA,Psychology and the science of science,"This is a critical review and integration of the movements in science and philosophy leading toward a ""science of science"" which embodies three levels: syntactics, semantics, and pragmatics. The movements known as operationism, logical positivism, and physicalism are considered in detail, and the implications of these movements, especially operationism, for psychology are emphasized. Three features of this embryonic science of science are said to be especially prominent: (1) ""The rational and empirical elements in science are disentangled and then reassembled according to a straightforward, workable plan."" (2) ""It is proposed that in our study of the science-maker we begin with the products of his activity--his finished propositions--rather than with his 'experiences' or any other phase of his earlier behavior."" (3) The science of science must go to psychology, particularly behavioristic psychology, for an answer to many of its problems. A ""case study of language"" and a note on the hypothetico-deductive method are included in appendices. An annotated bibliography of 67 titles is appended.

Lesche C.,6505762011,"Stockholm, Sweden",Behavioristisk kritik av psykoanalysen,"As fas as metascience is concerned, Schioldborg harbours a logico-empirical orientation which leaves him insufficiently qualified for an examination of psychoanalysis, the pure and the therapeutic as well as the existential. The pure psychoanalytical process may be described as harmeneutic-dialectical, shifting between hermeneutic phases with emphasis on understanding, and quasi-naturalistic phases, in which the analyst attempts to explain what neither the analysand nor the analyst understood, and so on. Because of the double character of psychoanalysis, it is not possible to adapt criteria of confirmation as is recommended by the logical empiricism for the natural or behavioral sciences. It is also erroneous to think, that psychoanalysis is an explanatory psychology and existential psychology an understanding one. Psychoanalysis is as well explanatory as understanding, whereas existential psychology totalizes the understanding aspect. Furthermore, in psychoanalysis the efficiency of therapy is no criterion of the system of knowledge which justifies the therapeutic technique. In deciding which kind of therapy to adopt, a number of factors must be taken into consideration: aims and their evaluations, selection of a naturalistic or humanistic ideal of science, etc. All treatments, in fact, are not directed towards identical aims and values are not based upon identical sciences, and, consequently, it is impossible to compare them with regard to their efficiency only. © 1971 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,Nordisk Psykologi,Article,1971,3,NA,Danish,10.1080/00291463.1971.10780329
